<p>It might seem that about Blaise Pascal, and about the two
works on which his fame is founded, everything that there is
to say had been said. The details of his life are as fully known
as we can expect to know them; his mathematical and
physical discoveries have been treated many times; his
religious sentiment and his theological views have been discussed
again and again; and his prose style has been analysed
by French critics down to the finest particular. But Pascal
is one of those writers who will be and who must be studied
afresh by men in every generation. It is not he who changes,
but we who change. It is not our knowledge of him that
increases, but our world that alters and our attitudes towards
it. The history of human opinions of Pascal and of men of
his stature is a part of the history of humanity. That indicates
his permanent importance.</p>

<p>The facts of Pascal's life, so far as they are necessary for
this brief introduction to the <i>Pensées</i>, are as follows. He
was born at Clermont, in Auvergne, in 1623. His family
were people of substance of the upper middle class. His
father was a government official, who was able to leave, when
he died, a sufficient patrimony to his one son and his two
daughters. In 1631 the father moved to Paris, and a few
years later took up another government post at Rouen.
Wherever he lived, the elder Pascal seems to have mingled
with some of the best society, and with men of eminence in
science and the arts. Blaise was educated entirely by his
father at home. He was exceedingly precocious, indeed
excessively precocious, for his application to studies in childhood
and adolescence impaired his health, and is held
responsible for his death at thirty-nine. Prodigious, though
not incredible stories are preserved, especially of his precocity
in mathematics. His mind was active rather than accumulative;
he showed from his earliest years that disposition to
find things out for himself, which has characterised the infancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
of Clerk-Maxwell and other scientists. Of his later discoveries
in physics there is no need for mention here; it must only be
remembered that he counts as one of the greatest physicists
and mathematicians of all time; and that his discoveries were
made during the years when most scientists are still apprentices.</p>

<p>The elder Pascal, Étienne, was a sincere Christian. About
1646 he fell in with some representatives of the religious
revival within the Church which has become known as
Jansenism—after Jansenius, Bishop of Ypres, whose theological
work is taken as the origin of the movement. This period is
usually spoken of as the moment of Pascal's "first conversion."
The word "conversion," however, is too forcible to be applied
at this point to Blaise Pascal himself. The family had always
been devout, and the younger Pascal, though absorbed in his
scientific work, never seems to have been afflicted with
infidelity. His attention was then directed, certainly, to
religious and theological matters; but the term "conversion"
can only be applied to his sisters—the elder, already Madame
Périer, and particularly the younger, Jacqueline, who at that
time conceived a vocation for the religious life. Pascal himself
was by no means disposed to renounce the world. After the
death of the father in 1650 Jacqueline, a young woman of
remarkable strength and beauty of character, wished to take
her vows as a sister of Port-Royal, and for some time her wish
remained unfulfilled owing to the opposition of her brother.
His objection was on the purely worldly ground that she
wished to make over her patrimony to the Order; whereas
while she lived with him, their combined resources made it
possible for him to live more nearly on a scale of expense
congenial to his tastes. He liked, in fact, not only to mix
with the best society, but to keep a coach and horses—six
horses is the number at one time attributed to his carriage.
Though he had no legal power to prevent his sister from
disposing of her property as she elected, the amiable Jacqueline
shrank from doing so without her brother's willing approval.
The Mother Superior, Mère Angélique—herself an eminent
personage in the history of this religious movement—finally
persuaded the young novice to enter the order without the
satisfaction of bringing her patrimony with her; but Jacqueline
remained so distressed by this situation that her brother
finally relented.</p>

<p>So far as is known, the worldly life enjoyed by Pascal during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
this period can hardly be qualified as "dissipation," and
certainly not as "debauchery." Even gambling may have
appealed to him chiefly as affording a study of mathematical
probabilities. He appears to have led such a life as any
cultivated intellectual man of good position and independent
means might lead and consider himself a model of probity
and virtue. Not even a love-affair is laid at his door, though
he is said to have contemplated marriage. But Jansenism,
as represented by the religious society of Port-Royal, was
morally a Puritan movement within the Church, and its
standards of conduct were at least as severe as those of any
Puritanism in England or America. The period of fashionable
society, in Pascal's life, is however, of great importance in his
development. It enlarged his knowledge of men and refined
his tastes; he became a man of the world and never lost what
he had learnt; and when he turned his thoughts wholly
towards religion, his worldly knowledge was a part of his
composition which is essential to the value of his work.</p>

<p>Pascal's interest in society did not distract him from
scientific research; nor did this period occupy much space in
what is a very short and crowded life. Partly his natural
dissatisfaction with such a life, once he had learned all it had
to teach him, partly the influence of his saintly sister Jacqueline,
partly increasing suffering as his health declined, directed
him more and more out of the world and to thoughts of eternity.
And in 1654 occurs what is called his "second conversion,"
but which might be called his conversion simply.</p>

<p>He made a note of his mystical experience, which he kept
always about him, and which was found, after his death,
sewn into the coat which he was wearing. The experience
occurred on 23 November, 1654, and there is no reason to
doubt its genuineness unless we choose to deny all mystical
experience. Now, Pascal was not a mystic, and his works
are not to be classified amongst mystical writings; but what
can only be called mystical experience happens to many men
who do not become mystics. The work which he undertook
soon after, the <i>Lettres écrites à un provincial</i>, is a masterpiece
of religious controversy at the opposite pole from mysticism.
We know quite well that he was at the time when he received
his illumination from God in extremely poor health; but it
is a commonplace that some forms of illness are extremely
favourable, not only to religious illumination, but to artistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
and literary composition. A piece of writing meditated,
apparently without progress, for months or years, may
suddenly take shape and word; and in this state long passages
may be produced which require little or no retouch. I have
no good word to say for the cultivation of automatic writing
as the model of literary composition; I doubt whether these
moments <i>can</i> be cultivated by the writer; but he to whom
this happens assuredly has the sensation of being a vehicle
rather than a maker. No masterpiece can be produced
whole by such means; but neither does even the higher form
of religious inspiration suffice for the religious life; even the
most exalted mystic must return to the world, and use his
reason to employ the results of his experience in daily life.
You may call it communion with the Divine, or you may call
it a temporary crystallisation of the mind. Until science
can teach us to reproduce such phenomena at will, science
cannot claim to have explained them; and they can be judged
only by their fruits.</p>

<p>From that time until his death, Pascal was closely associated
with the society of Port-Royal which his sister Jacqueline, who
predeceased him, had joined as a <i>religieuse</i>; the society was
then fighting for its life against the Jesuits. Five propositions,
judged by a committee of cardinals and theologians
at Rome to be heretical, were found to be put forward in
the work of Jansenius; and the society of Port-Royal, the
representative of Jansenism among devotional communities,
suffered a blow from which it never revived. It is not the
place here to review the bitter controversy and conflict; the
best account, from the point of view of a critic of genius who
took no side, who was neither Jansenist nor Jesuit, Christian
nor infidel, is that in the great book of Sainte-Beuve, <i>Port-Royal</i>.
And in this book the parts devoted to Pascal himself
are among the most brilliant pages of criticism that Sainte-Beuve
ever wrote. It is sufficient to notice that the next
occupation of Pascal, after his conversion, was to write these
eighteen "Letters," which as prose are of capital importance
in the foundation of French classical style, and which as
polemic are surpassed by none, not by Demosthenes, or
Cicero, or Swift. They have the limitation of all polemic and
forensic: they persuade, they seduce, they are unfair. But it
is also unfair to assert that, in these <i>Letters to a Provincial</i>,
Pascal was attacking the Society of Jesus in itself. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
attacking rather a particular school of casuistry which relaxed
the requirements of the Confessional; a school which certainly
flourished amongst the Society of Jesus at that time, and of
which the Spaniards Escobar and Molina are the most
eminent authorities. He undoubtedly abused the art of
quotation, as a polemical writer can hardly help but do; but
there were abuses for him to abuse; and he did the job
thoroughly. His <i>Letters</i> must not be called theology.
Academic theology was not a department in which Pascal
was versed; when necessary, the fathers of Port-Royal came
to his aid. The <i>Letters</i> are the work of one of the finest
mathematical minds of any time, and of a man of the world
who addressed, not theologians, but the world in general—all
of the cultivated and many of the less cultivated of the
French laity; and with this public they made an astonishing
success.</p>

<p>During this time Pascal never wholly abandoned his
scientific interests. Though in his religious writings he
composed slowly and painfully, and revised often, in matters
of mathematics his mind seemed to move with consummate
natural ease and grace. Discoveries and inventions sprang
from his brain without effort; among the minor devices of
this later period, the first omnibus service in Paris is said to
owe its origin to his inventiveness. But rapidly failing health,
and absorption in the great work he had in mind, left him
little time and energy during the last two years of his life.</p>

<p>The plan of what we call the <i>Pensées</i> formed itself about
1660. The completed book was to have been a carefully
constructed defence of Christianity, a true Apology and a
kind of Grammar of Assent, setting forth the reasons which
will convince the intellect. As I have indicated before,
Pascal was not a theologian, and on dogmatic theology had
recourse to his spiritual advisers. Nor was he indeed a
systematic philosopher. He was a man with an immense
genius for science, and at the same time a natural psychologist
and moralist. As he was a great literary artist, his book
would have been also his own spiritual autobiography; his
style, free from all diminishing idiosyncrasies, was yet very
personal. Above all, he was a man of strong passions; and
his intellectual passion for truth was reinforced by his passionate
dissatisfaction with human life unless a spiritual
explanation could be found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span></p>

<p>We must regard the <i>Pensées</i> as merely the first notes for
a work which he left far from completion; we have, in Sainte-Beuve's
words, a tower of which the stones have been laid
on each other, but not cemented, and the structure unfinished.
In early years his memory had been amazingly retentive of
anything that he wished to remember; and had it not been
impaired by increasing illness and pain, he probably would
not have been obliged to set down these notes at all. But
taking the book as it is left to us, we still find that it occupies
a unique place in the history of French literature and in the
history of religious meditation.</p>

<p>To understand the method which Pascal employs, the
reader must be prepared to follow the process of the mind of
the intelligent believer. The Christian thinker—and I mean
the man who is trying consciously and conscientiously to
explain to himself the sequence which culminated in faith,
rather than the public apologist—proceeds by rejection and
elimination. He finds the world to be so and so; he finds its
character inexplicable by any non-religious theory; among
religions he finds Christianity, and Catholic Christianity, to
account most satisfactorily for the world and especially for
the moral world within; and thus, by what Newman calls
"powerful and concurrent" reasons, he finds himself inexorably
committed to the dogma of the Incarnation. To the unbeliever,
this method seems disingenuous and perverse; for
the unbeliever is, as a rule, not so greatly troubled to explain
the world to himself, nor so greatly distressed by its disorder;
nor is he generally concerned (in modern terms) to "preserve
values." He does not consider that if certain emotional
states, certain developments of character, and what in the
highest sense can be called "saintliness" are inherently and
by inspection known to be good, then the satisfactory explanation
of the world must be an explanation which will admit
the "reality" of these values. Nor does he consider such
reasoning admissible; he would, so to speak, trim his values
according to his cloth, because to him such values are of no
great value. The unbeliever starts from the other end, and
as likely as not with the question: Is a case of human
parthenogenesis credible? and this he would call going straight
to the heart of the matter. Now Pascal's method is, on the
whole, the method natural and right for the Christian; and
the opposite method is that taken by Voltaire. It is worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
while to remember that Voltaire, in his attempt to refute
Pascal, has given once and for all the type of such refutation;
and that later opponents of Pascal's Apology for the Christian
Faith have contributed little beyond psychological irrelevancies.
For Voltaire has presented, better than any one
since, what is the unbelieving point of view; and in the end
we must all choose for ourselves between one point of view
and another.</p>

<p>I have said above that Pascal's method is "on the whole"
that of the typical Christian apologist; and this reservation
was directed at Pascal's belief in miracles, which plays a
larger part in his construction than it would in that, at least,
of the modern liberal Catholic. It would seem fantastic to
accept Christianity because we first believe the Gospel
miracles to be true, and it would seem impious to accept it
primarily because we believe more recent miracles to be
true; we accept the miracles, or some miracles, to be true
because we believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ: we found our
belief in the miracles on the Gospel, not our belief in the Gospel
on the miracles. But it must be remembered that Pascal
had been deeply impressed by a contemporary miracle, known
as the miracle of the Holy Thorn: a thorn reputed to have
been preserved from the Crown of Our Lord was pressed upon
an ulcer which quickly healed. Sainte-Beuve, who as a medical
man felt himself on solid ground, discusses fully the possible
explanation of this apparent miracle. It is true that the
miracle happened at Port-Royal, and that it arrived opportunely
to revive the depressed spirits of the community in
its political afflictions; and it is likely that Pascal was the
more inclined to believe a miracle which was performed upon
his beloved sister. In any case, it probably led him to assign
a place to miracles, in his study of faith, which is not quite
that which we should give to them ourselves.</p>

<p>Now the great adversary against whom Pascal set himself,
from the time of his first conversations with M. de Saci at
Port-Royal, was Montaigne. One cannot destroy Pascal,
certainly; but of all authors Montaigne is one of the least
destructible. You could as well dissipate a fog by flinging
hand-grenades into it. For Montaigne is a fog, a gas, a fluid,
insidious element. He does not reason, he insinuates, charms,
and influences; or if he reasons, you must be prepared for his
having some other design upon you than to convince you by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
his argument. It is hardly too much to say that Montaigne
is the most essential author to know, if we would understand
the course of French thought during the last three hundred
years. In every way, the influence of Montaigne was
repugnant to the men of Port-Royal. Pascal studied him
with the intention of demolishing him. Yet, in the <i>Pensées</i>,
at the very end of his life, we find passage after passage, and
the slighter they are the more significant, almost "lifted"
out of Montaigne, down to a figure of speech or a word. The
parallels<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> are most often with the long essay of Montaigne
called <i>Apologie de Raymond Sébond</i>—an astonishing piece
of writing upon which Shakespeare also probably drew in
<i>Hamlet</i>. Indeed, by the time a man knew Montaigne well
enough to attack him, he would already be thoroughly infected
by him.</p>

<p>It would, however, be grossly unfair to Pascal, to Montaigne,
and indeed to French literature, to leave the matter at that.
It is no diminution of Pascal, but only an aggrandisement of
Montaigne. Had Montaigne been an ordinary life-sized
sceptic, a small man like Anatole France, or even a greater
man like Renan, or even like the greatest sceptic of all,
Voltaire, this "influence" would be to the discredit of Pascal;
but if Montaigne had been no more than Voltaire, he could
not have affected Pascal at all. The picture of Montaigne
which offers itself first to our eyes, that of the original and
independent solitary "personality," absorbed in amused
analysis of himself, is deceptive. Montaigne's is no <i>limited</i>
Pyrrhonism, like that of Voltaire, Renan, or France. He
exists, so to speak, on a plan of numerous concentric circles,
the most apparent of which is the small inmost circle, a personal
puckish scepticism which can be easily aped if not imitated.
But what makes Montaigne a very great figure is that he
succeeded, God knows how—for Montaigne very likely did
not know that he had done it—it is not the sort of thing that
men <i>can</i> observe about themselves, for it is essentially bigger
than the individual's consciousness—he succeeded in giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
expression to the scepticism of <i>every</i> human being. For
every man who thinks and lives by thought must have his
own scepticism, that which stops at the question, that which
ends in denial, or that which leads to faith and which is
somehow integrated into the faith which transcends it. And
Pascal, as the type of one kind of religious believer, which is
highly passionate and ardent, but passionate only through a
powerful and regulated intellect, is in the first sections of his
unfinished Apology for Christianity facing unflinchingly the
demon of doubt which is inseparable from the spirit of belief.</p>

<p>There is accordingly something quite different from an
influence which would prove Pascal's weakness; there is a
real affinity between his doubt and that of Montaigne; and
through the common kinship with Montaigne Pascal is related
to the noble and distinguished line of French moralists, from
La Rochefoucauld down. In the honesty with which they
face the <i>données</i> of the actual world this French tradition
has a unique quality in European literature, and in the
seventeenth century Hobbes is crude and uncivilised in
comparison.</p>

<p>Pascal is a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic
among men of the world; he had the knowledge of worldliness
and the passion of asceticism, and in him the two are fused
into an individual whole. The majority of mankind is
lazy-minded, incurious, absorbed in vanities, and tepid in
emotion, and is therefore incapable of either much doubt
or much faith; and when the ordinary man calls himself a
sceptic or an unbeliever, that is ordinarily a simple pose,
cloaking a disinclination to think anything out to a conclusion.
Pascal's disillusioned analysis of human bondage is sometimes
interpreted to mean that Pascal was really and finally an
unbeliever, who, in his despair, was incapable of enduring
reality and enjoying the heroic satisfaction of the free man's
worship of nothing. His despair, his disillusion, are, however,
no illustration of personal weakness; they are perfectly
objective, because they are essential moments in the progress
of the intellectual soul; and for the type of Pascal they are
the analogue of the drought, the dark night, which is an
essential stage in the progress of the Christian mystic. A
similar despair, when it is arrived at by a diseased character
or an impure soul, may issue in the most disastrous consequences
though with the most superb manifestations; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
thus we get <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>; but in Pascal we find no such
distortion; his despair is in itself more terrible than Swift's,
because our heart tells us that it corresponds exactly to the
facts and cannot be dismissed as mental disease; but it was
also a despair which was a necessary prelude to, and element
in, the joy of faith.</p>

<p>I do not wish to enter any further than necessary upon the
question of the heterodoxy of Jansenism; and it is no concern
of this essay, whether the Five Propositions condemned at
Rome were really maintained by Jansenius in his book
<i>Augustinus</i>; or whether we should deplore or approve the
consequent decay (indeed with some persecution) of Port-Royal.
It is impossible to discuss the matter without becoming
involved as a controversialist either for or against Rome.
But in a man of the type of Pascal—and the type always
exists—there is, I think, an ingredient of what may be called
Jansenism of temperament, without identifying it with the
Jansenism of Jansenius and of other devout and sincere, but
not immensely gifted doctors.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> It is accordingly needful to
state in brief what the dangerous doctrine of Jansenius was,
without advancing too far into theological refinements. It is
recognised in Christian theology—and indeed on a lower plane
it is recognised by all men in affairs of daily life—that freewill
or the natural effort and ability of the individual man,
and also supernatural <i>grace</i>, a gift accorded we know not
quite how, are both required, in co-operation, for salvation.
Though numerous theologians have set their wits at the
problem, it ends in a mystery which we can perceive but not
finally decipher. At least, it is obvious that, like any doctrine,
a slight excess or deviation to one side or the other will precipitate
a heresy. The Pelagians, who were refuted by St.
Augustine, emphasised the efficacy of human effort and
belittled the importance of supernatural grace. The Calvinists
emphasised the degradation of man through Original Sin, and
considered mankind so corrupt that the will was of no avail;
and thus fell into the doctrine of predestination. It was upon
the doctrine of grace according to St. Augustine that the
Jansenists relied; and the <i>Augustinus</i> of Jansenius was
presented as a sound exposition of the Augustinian views.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>Such heresies are never antiquated, because they forever
assume new forms. For instance, the insistence upon good
works and "service" which is preached from many quarters,
or the simple faith that any one who lives a good and useful
life need have no "morbid" anxieties about salvation, is a
form of Pelagianism. On the other hand, one sometimes
hears enounced the view that it will make no real difference
if all the traditional religious sanctions for moral behaviour
break down, because those who are born and bred to be nice
people will always prefer to behave nicely, and those who are
not will behave otherwise in any case: and this is surely a form
of predestination—for the hazard of being born a nice person
or not is as uncertain as the gift of grace.</p>

<p>It is likely that Pascal was attracted as much by the fruits
of Jansenism in the life of Port-Royal as by the doctrine
itself. This devout, ascetic, thoroughgoing society, striving
heroically in the midst of a relaxed and easy-going Christianity,
was formed to attract a nature so concentrated, so passionate,
and so thoroughgoing as Pascal's. But the insistence upon
the degraded and helpless state of man, in Jansenism, is
something also to which we must be grateful, for to it we owe
the magnificent analysis of human motives and occupations
which was to have constituted the early part of his book.
And apart from the Jansenism which is the work of a not
very eminent bishop who wrote a Latin treatise which is now
unread, there is also, so to speak, a Jansenism of the individual
biography. A moment of Jansenism may naturally take
place, and take place rightly, in the individual; particularly
in the life of a man of great and intense intellectual powers,
who cannot avoid seeing through human beings and observing
the vanity of their thoughts and of their avocations, their
dishonesty and self-deceptions, the insincerity of their emotions,
their cowardice, the pettiness of their real ambitions.
Actually, considering that Pascal died at the age of thirty-nine,
one must be amazed at the balance and justice of his observations;
much greater maturity is required for these qualities,
than for any mathematical or scientific greatness. How
easily his brooding on <i>the misery of man without God</i> might
have encouraged in him the sin of spiritual pride, the <i>concupiscence
de l'esprit</i>, and how fast a hold he has of humility!</p>

<p>And although Pascal brings to his work the same powers
which he exerted in science, it is not as a scientist that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
presents himself. He does not seem to say to the reader:
I am one of the most distinguished scientists of the day; I
understand many matters which will always be mysteries to
you, and through science I have come to the Faith; you therefore
who are not initiated into science ought to have faith if I
have it. He is fully aware of the difference of subject-matter;
and his famous distinction between the <i>esprit de géométrie</i>
and the <i>esprit de finesse</i> is one to ponder over. It is the just
combination of the scientist, the <i>honnête homme</i>, and the
religious nature with a passionate craving for God, that makes
Pascal unique. He succeeds where Descartes fails; for in
Descartes the element of <i>esprit de géométrie</i> is excessive.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
And in a few phrases about Descartes, in the present book,
Pascal laid his finger on the place of weakness.</p>

<p>He who reads this book will observe at once its fragmentary
nature; but only after some study will perceive that the
fragmentariness lies in the expression more than in the thought.
The "thoughts" cannot be detached from each other and
quoted as if each were complete in itself. <i>Le cœur a ses
raisons que la raison ne connaît point</i>: how often one has heard
that quoted, and quoted often to the wrong purpose! For this
is by no means an exaltation of the "heart" over the "head,"
a defence of unreason. The heart, in Pascal's terminology,
is itself truly rational if it is truly the heart. For him, in
theological matters, which seemed to him much larger, more
difficult, and more important than scientific matters, the whole
personality is involved.</p>

<p>We cannot quite understand any of the parts, fragmentary
as they are, without some understanding of the whole.
Capital, for instance, is his analysis of the <i>three orders</i>: the
order of nature, the order of mind, and the order of charity.
These three are <i>discontinuous</i>; the higher is not implicit in the
lower as in an evolutionary doctrine it would be.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> In this
distinction Pascal offers much about which the modern world
would do well to think. And indeed, because of his unique
combination and balance of qualities, I know of no religious
writer more pertinent to our time. The great mystics like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
St. John of the Cross, are primarily for readers with a special
determination of purpose; the devotional writers, such as St.
François de Sales, are primarily for those who already feel
consciously desirous of the love of God; the great theologians
are for those interested in theology. But I can think of no
Christian writer, not Newman even, more to be commended
than Pascal to those who doubt, but who have the mind to
conceive, and the sensibility to feel, the disorder, the futility,
the meaninglessness, the mystery of life and suffering, and who
can only find peace through a satisfaction of the whole being.</p>

<h3>THOUGHTS ON MIND AND ON STYLE</h3>


<h4><a name="p_1" id="p_1"></a>1</h4>


<p><i>The difference between the mathematical and the intuitive mind.</i><a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>—In
the one the principles are palpable, but removed from ordinary
use; so that for want of habit it is difficult to turn one's mind
in that direction: but if one turns it thither ever so little, one
sees the principles fully, and one must have a quite inaccurate
mind who reasons wrongly from principles so plain that it is
almost impossible they should escape notice.</p>

<p>But in the intuitive mind the principles are found in common
use, and are before the eyes of everybody. One has only to
look, and no effort is necessary; it is only a question of good
eyesight, but it must be good, for the principles are so subtle
and so numerous, that it is almost impossible but that some
escape notice. Now the omission of one principle leads to
error; thus one must have very clear sight to see all the principles,
and in the next place an accurate mind not to draw false
deductions from known principles.</p>

<p>All mathematicians would then be intuitive if they had clear
sight, for they do not reason incorrectly from principles known
to them; and intuitive minds would be mathematical if they
could turn their eyes to the principles of mathematics to which
they are unused.</p>

<p>The reason, therefore, that some intuitive minds are not
mathematical is that they cannot at all turn their attention
to the principles of mathematics. But the reason that mathematicians
are not intuitive is that they do not see what is
before them, and that, accustomed to the exact and plain principles
of mathematics, and not reasoning till they have well
inspected and arranged their principles, they are lost in matters
of intuition where the principles do not allow of such arrangement.
They are scarcely seen; they are felt rather than seen;
there is the greatest difficulty in making them felt by those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
who do not of themselves perceive them. These principles are
so fine and so numerous that a very delicate and very clear
sense is needed to perceive them, and to judge rightly and
justly when they are perceived, without for the most part being
able to demonstrate them in order as in mathematics; because
the principles are not known to us in the same way, and because
it would be an endless matter to undertake it. We must see
the matter at once, at one glance, and not by a process of
reasoning, at least to a certain degree. And thus it is rare that
mathematicians are intuitive, and that men of intuition are
mathematicians, because mathematicians wish to treat matters
of intuition mathematically, and make themselves ridiculous,
wishing to begin with definitions and then with axioms, which
is not the way to proceed in this kind of reasoning. Not that
the mind does not do so, but it does it tacitly, naturally, and
without technical rules; for the expression of it is beyond all
men, and only a few can feel it.</p>

<p>Intuitive minds, on the contrary, being thus accustomed to
judge at a single glance, are so astonished when they are presented
with propositions of which they understand nothing,
and the way to which is through definitions and axioms so
sterile, and which they are not accustomed to see thus in detail,
that they are repelled and disheartened.</p>

<p>But dull minds are never either intuitive or mathematical.</p>

<p>Mathematicians who are only mathematicians have exact
minds, provided all things are explained to them by means of
definitions and axioms; otherwise they are inaccurate and
insufferable, for they are only right when the principles are
quite clear.</p>

<p>And men of intuition who are only intuitive cannot have
the patience to reach to first principles of things speculative
and conceptual, which they have never seen in the world, and
which are altogether out of the common.</p>


<h4><a name="p_2" id="p_2"></a>2</h4>

<p>There are different kinds of right understanding;<a name="FNanchor_2_6" id="FNanchor_2_6"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_2_6" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> some have
right understanding in a certain order of things, and not in
others, where they go astray. Some draw conclusions well
from a few premises, and this displays an acute judgment.</p>

<p>Others draw conclusions well where there are many premises.</p>

<p>For example, the former easily learn hydrostatics, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
premises are few, but the conclusions are so fine that only
the greatest acuteness can reach them.</p>

<p>And in spite of that these persons would perhaps not be
great mathematicians, because mathematics contain a great
number of premises, and there is perhaps a kind of intellect
that can search with ease a few premises to the bottom, and
cannot in the least penetrate those matters in which there are
many premises.</p>

<p>There are then two kinds of intellect: the one able to penetrate
acutely and deeply into the conclusions of given premises, and
this is the precise intellect; the other able to comprehend a
great number of premises without confusing them, and this is
the mathematical intellect. The one has force and exactness,
the other comprehension. Now the one quality can exist without
the other; the intellect can be strong and narrow, and can
also be comprehensive and weak.</p>


<h4><a name="p_3" id="p_3"></a>3</h4>

<p>Those who are accustomed to judge by feeling do not understand
the process of reasoning, for they would understand at
first sight, and are not used to seek for principles. And others,
on the contrary, who are accustomed to reason from principles,
do not at all understand matters of feeling, seeking principles,
and being unable to see at a glance.</p>


<h4><a name="p_4" id="p_4"></a>4</h4>

<p><i>Mathematics, intuition.</i>—True eloquence makes light of
eloquence, true morality makes light of morality; that is to say,
the morality of the judgment, which has no rules, makes light
of the morality of the intellect.</p>

<p>For it is to judgment that perception belongs, as science
belongs to intellect. Intuition is the part of judgment,
mathematics of intellect.</p>

<p>To make light of philosophy is to be a true philosopher.</p>


<h4><a name="p_5" id="p_5"></a>5</h4>

<p>Those who judge of a work by rule<a name="FNanchor_3_7" id="FNanchor_3_7"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_3_7" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> are in regard to others
as those who have a watch are in regard to others. One says,
"It is two hours ago"; the other says, "It is only three-quarters
of an hour." I look at my watch, and say to the one, "You
are weary," and to the other, "Time gallops with you"; for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
is only an hour and a half ago, and I laugh at those who tell me
that time goes slowly with me, and that I judge by imagination.
They do not know that I judge by my watch.<a name="FNanchor_4_8" id="FNanchor_4_8"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_4_8" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>


<h4><a name="p_6" id="p_6"></a>6</h4>

<p>Just as we harm the understanding, we harm the feelings also.</p>

<p>The understanding and the feelings are moulded by intercourse;
the understanding and feelings are corrupted by intercourse.
Thus good or bad society improves or corrupts them.
It is, then, all-important to know how to choose in order to
improve and not to corrupt them; and we cannot make this
choice, if they be not already improved and not corrupted. Thus
a circle is formed, and those are fortunate who escape it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_7" id="p_7"></a>7</h4>

<p>The greater intellect one has, the more originality one finds in
men. Ordinary persons find no difference between men.</p>


<h4><a name="p_8" id="p_8"></a>8</h4>

<p>There are many people who listen to a sermon in the same
way as they listen to vespers.</p>


<h4><a name="p_9" id="p_9"></a>9</h4>

<p>When we wish to correct with advantage, and to show another
that he errs, we must notice from what side he views the matter,
for on that side it is usually true, and admit that truth to him,
but reveal to him the side on which it is false. He is satisfied
with that, for he sees that he was not mistaken, and that he
only failed to see all sides. Now, no one is offended at not
seeing everything; but one does not like to be mistaken, and
that perhaps arises from the fact that man naturally cannot
see everything, and that naturally he cannot err in the side he
looks at, since the perceptions of our senses are always true.</p>


<h4><a name="p_10" id="p_10"></a>10</h4>

<p>People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which
they have themselves discovered than by those which have
come into the mind of others.</p>


<h4><a name="p_11" id="p_11"></a>11</h4>

<p>All great amusements are dangerous to the Christian life;
but among all those which the world has invented there is none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
more to be feared than the theatre. It is a representation of
the passions so natural and so delicate that it excites them and
gives birth to them in our hearts, and, above all, to that of love,
principally when it is represented as very chaste and virtuous.
For the more innocent it appears to innocent souls, the more
they are likely to be touched by it. Its violence pleases our
self-love, which immediately forms a desire to produce the
same effects which are seen so well represented; and, at the
same time, we make ourselves a conscience founded on the
propriety of the feelings which we see there, by which the
fear of pure souls is removed, since they imagine that it cannot
hurt their purity to love with a love which seems to them
so reasonable.</p>

<p>So we depart from the theatre with our heart so filled with
all the beauty and tenderness of love, the soul and the mind
so persuaded of its innocence, that we are quite ready to receive
its first impressions, or rather to seek an opportunity of awakening
them in the heart of another, in order that we may receive
the same pleasures and the same sacrifices which we have seen
so well represented in the theatre.</p>


<h4><a name="p_12" id="p_12"></a>12</h4>

<p>Scaramouch,<a name="FNanchor_5_9" id="FNanchor_5_9"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_5_9" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> who only thinks of one thing.</p>

<p>The doctor,<a name="FNanchor_6_10" id="FNanchor_6_10"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_6_10" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who speaks for a quarter of an hour after he has
said everything, so full is he of the desire of talking.</p>


<h4><a name="p_13" id="p_13"></a>13</h4>

<p>One likes to see the error, the passion of Cleobuline,<a name="FNanchor_7_11" id="FNanchor_7_11"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_7_11" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> because
she is unconscious of it. She would be displeasing, if she were
not deceived.</p>


<h4><a name="p_14" id="p_14"></a>14</h4>

<p>When a natural discourse paints a passion or an effect, one
feels within oneself the truth of what one reads, which was there
before, although one did not know it. Hence one is inclined
to love him who makes us feel it, for he has not shown us his
own riches, but ours. And thus this benefit renders him pleasing
to us, besides that such community of intellect as we have with
him necessarily inclines the heart to love.</p>


<h4><a name="p_15" id="p_15"></a>15</h4>

<p>Eloquence, which persuades by sweetness, not by authority;
as a tyrant, not as a king.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_16" id="p_16"></a>16</h4>

<p>Eloquence is an art of saying things in such a way—(1) that
those to whom we speak may listen to them without pain and
with pleasure; (2) that they feel themselves interested, so that
self-love leads them more willingly to reflection upon it.</p>

<p>It consists, then, in a correspondence which we seek to
establish between the head and the heart of those to whom we
speak on the one hand, and, on the other, between the thoughts
and the expressions which we employ. This assumes that we
have studied well the heart of man so as to know all its powers,
and then to find the just proportions of the discourse which we
wish to adapt to them. We must put ourselves in the place
of those who are to hear us, and make trial on our own heart
of the turn which we give to our discourse in order to see
whether one is made for the other, and whether we can assure
ourselves that the hearer will be, as it were, forced to surrender.
We ought to restrict ourselves, so far as possible, to the simple
and natural, and not to magnify that which is little, or belittle
that which is great. It is not enough that a thing be beautiful;
it must be suitable to the subject, and there must be in it
nothing of excess or defect.</p>


<h4><a name="p_17" id="p_17"></a>17</h4>

<p>Rivers are roads which move,<a name="FNanchor_8_12" id="FNanchor_8_12"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_8_12" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and which carry us whither
we desire to go.</p>


<h4><a name="p_18" id="p_18"></a>18</h4>

<p>When we do not know the truth of a thing, it is of advantage
that there should exist a common error which determines the
mind of man, as, for example, the moon, to which is attributed
the change of seasons, the progress of diseases, etc. For the
chief malady of man is restless curiosity about things which he
cannot understand; and it is not so bad for him to be in error
as to be curious to no purpose.</p>

<p>The manner in which Epictetus, Montaigne, and Salomon
de Tultie<a name="FNanchor_9_13" id="FNanchor_9_13"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_9_13" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> wrote, is the most usual, the most suggestive, the
most remembered, and the oftenest quoted; because it is entirely
composed of thoughts born from the common talk of life. As
when we speak of the common error which exists among men
that the moon is the cause of everything, we never fail to say
that Salomon de Tultie says that when we do not know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
truth of a thing, it is of advantage that there should exist a
common error, etc.; which is the thought above.</p>


<h4><a name="p_19" id="p_19"></a>19</h4>

<p>The last thing one settles in writing a book is what one
should put in first.</p>


<h4><a name="p_20" id="p_20"></a>20</h4>

<p><i>Order.</i>—Why should I undertake to divide my virtues into four
rather than into six? Why should I rather establish virtue in
four, in two, in one? Why into <i>Abstine et sustine</i><a name="FNanchor_10_14" id="FNanchor_10_14"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_10_14" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> rather than
into "Follow Nature,"<a name="FNanchor_11_15" id="FNanchor_11_15"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_11_15" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> or, "Conduct your private affairs without
injustice," as Plato,<a name="FNanchor_12_16" id="FNanchor_12_16"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_12_16" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> or anything else? But there, you will
say, everything is contained in one word. Yes, but it is useless
without explanation, and when we come to explain it, as soon
as we unfold this maxim which contains all the rest, they
emerge in that first confusion which you desired to avoid. So,
when they are all included in one, they are hidden and useless,
as in a chest, and never appear save in their natural confusion.
Nature has established them all without including one in
the other.</p>


<h4><a name="p_21" id="p_21"></a>21</h4>

<p>Nature has made all her truths independent of one another.
Our art makes one dependent on the other. But this is not
natural. Each keeps its own place.</p>


<h4><a name="p_22" id="p_22"></a>22</h4>

<p>Let no one say that I have said nothing new; the arrangement
of the subject is new. When we play tennis, we both play with
the same ball, but one of us places it better.</p>

<p>I had as soon it said that I used words employed before.
And in the same way if the same thoughts in a different arrangement
do not form a different discourse, no more do the same
words in their different arrangement form different thoughts!</p>


<h4><a name="p_23" id="p_23"></a>23</h4>

<p>Words differently arranged have a different meaning, and
meanings differently arranged have different effects.</p>


<h4><a name="p_24" id="p_24"></a>24</h4>

<p><i>Language.</i>—We should not turn the mind from one thing to
another, except for relaxation, and that when it is necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and the time suitable, and not otherwise. For he that relaxes
out of season wearies, and he who wearies us out of season
makes us languid, since we turn quite away. So much does our
perverse lust like to do the contrary of what those wish to obtain
from us without giving us pleasure, the coin for which we will
do whatever is wanted.</p>


<h4><a name="p_25" id="p_25"></a>25</h4>

<p><i>Eloquence.</i>—It requires the pleasant and the real; but the
pleasant must itself be drawn from the true.</p>


<h4><a name="p_26" id="p_26"></a>26</h4>

<p>Eloquence is a painting of thought; and thus those who,
after having painted it, add something more, make a picture
instead of a portrait.</p>


<h4><a name="p_27" id="p_27"></a>27</h4>

<p><i>Miscellaneous. Language.</i>—Those who make antitheses by
forcing words are like those who make false windows for symmetry.
Their rule is not to speak accurately, but to make
apt figures of speech.</p>


<h4><a name="p_28" id="p_28"></a>28</h4>

<p>Symmetry is what we see at a glance; based on the fact that
there is no reason for any difference, and based also on the face
of man; whence it happens that symmetry is only wanted in
breadth, not in height or depth.</p>


<h4><a name="p_29" id="p_29"></a>29</h4>

<p>When we see a natural style, we are astonished and delighted;
for we expected to see an author, and we find a man. Whereas
those who have good taste, and who seeing a book expect to
find a man, are quite surprised to find an author. <i>Plus poetice
quam humane locutus es.</i> Those honour Nature well, who teach
that she can speak on everything, even on theology.</p>


<h4><a name="p_30" id="p_30"></a>30</h4>

<p>We only consult the ear because the heart is wanting. The
rule is uprightness.</p>

<p>Beauty of omission, of judgment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_31" id="p_31"></a>31</h4>

<p>All the false beauties which we blame in Cicero have their

<h4><a name="p_32" id="p_32"></a>32</h4>

<p>There is a certain standard of grace and beauty which consists
in a certain relation between our nature, such as it is, weak or
strong, and the thing which pleases us.</p>

<p>Whatever is formed according to this standard pleases us, be
it house, song, discourse, verse, prose, woman, birds, rivers,
trees, rooms, dress, etc. Whatever is not made according to
this standard displeases those who have good taste.</p>

<p>And as there is a perfect relation between a song and a house
which are made after a good model, because they are like this
good model, though each after its kind; even so there is a perfect
relation between things made after a bad model. Not that the
bad model is unique, for there are many; but each bad sonnet,
for example, on whatever false model it is formed, is just like a
woman dressed after that model.</p>

<p>Nothing makes us understand better the ridiculousness of a
false sonnet than to consider nature and the standard, and then
to imagine a woman or a house made according to that standard.</p>


<h4><a name="p_33" id="p_33"></a>33</h4>

<p><i>Poetical beauty.</i>—As we speak of poetical beauty, so ought we
to speak of mathematical beauty and medical beauty. But
we do not do so; and the reason is that we know well what is the
object of mathematics, and that it consists in proofs, and what
is the object of medicine, and that it consists in healing. But
we do not know in what grace consists, which is the object of
poetry. We do not know the natural model which we ought to
imitate; and through lack of this knowledge, we have coined
fantastic terms, "The golden age," "The wonder of our times,"
"Fatal," etc., and call this jargon poetical beauty.<a name="FNanchor_13_17" id="FNanchor_13_17"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_13_17" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>But whoever imagines a woman after this model, which
consists in saying little things in big words, will see a pretty
girl adorned with mirrors and chains, at whom he will smile;
because we know better wherein consists the charm of woman
than the charm of verse. But those who are ignorant would
admire her in this dress, and there are many villages in which
she would be taken for the queen; hence we call sonnets made
after this model "Village Queens."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_34" id="p_34"></a>34</h4>

<p>No one passes in the world as skilled in verse unless he has
put up the sign of a poet, a mathematician, etc. But educated
people do not want a sign, and draw little distinction between
the trade of a poet and that of an embroiderer.</p>

<p>People of education are not called poets or mathematicians,
etc.; but they are all these, and judges of all these. No one
guesses what they are. When they come into society, they talk
on matters about which the rest are talking. We do not observe
in them one quality rather than another, save when they have
to make use of it. But then we remember it, for it is characteristic
of such persons that we do not say of them that they are
fine speakers, when it is not a question of oratory, and that we
say of them that they are fine speakers, when it is such a
question.</p>

<p>It is therefore false praise to give a man when we say of him,
on his entry, that he is a very clever poet; and it is a bad sign
when a man is not asked to give his judgment on some verses.</p>


<h4><a name="p_35" id="p_35"></a>35</h4>

<p>We should not be able to say of a man, "He is a mathematician,"
or "a preacher," or "eloquent"; but that he is "a
gentleman." That universal quality alone pleases me. It is
a bad sign when, on seeing a person, you remember his book.
I would prefer you to see no quality till you meet it and have
occasion to use it (<i>Ne quid nimis</i><a name="FNanchor_14_18" id="FNanchor_14_18"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_14_18" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>), for fear some one quality
prevail and designate the man. Let none think him a fine
speaker, unless oratory be in question, and then let them think it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_36" id="p_36"></a>36</h4>

<p>Man is full of wants: he loves only those who can satisfy
them all. "This one is a good mathematician," one will say.
But I have nothing to do with mathematics; he would take me
for a proposition. "That one is a good soldier." He would
take me for a besieged town. I need, then, an upright man
who can accommodate himself generally to all my wants.</p>


<h4><a name="p_37" id="p_37"></a>37</h4>

<p>[Since we cannot be universal and know all that is to be
known of everything, we ought to know a little about everything.
For it is far better to know something about everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
than to know all about one thing. This universality is the
best. If we can have both, still better; but if we must choose,
we ought to choose the former. And the world feels this and
does so; for the world is often a good judge.]</p>

<p>If lightning fell on low places, etc., poets, and those who

<h4><a name="p_40" id="p_40"></a>40</h4>

<p>If we wished to prove the examples which we take to prove
other things, we should have to take those other things to be
examples; for, as we always believe the difficulty is in what
we wish to prove, we find the examples clearer and a help to
demonstration.</p>

<p>Thus when we wish to demonstrate a general theorem, we
must give the rule as applied to a particular case; but if we wish
to demonstrate a particular case, we must begin with the general
rule. For we always find the thing obscure which we wish to
prove, and that clear which we use for the proof; for, when a
thing is put forward to be proved, we first fill ourselves with the
imagination that it is therefore obscure, and on the contrary
that what is to prove it is clear, and so we understand it easily.</p>

like this: to show the vanity of all conditions of men, to show
the vanity of ordinary lives, and then the vanity of philosophic
lives, sceptics, stoics; but the order would not have been kept.
I know a little what it is, and how few people understand it.
No human science can keep it. Saint Thomas<a name="FNanchor_20_24" id="FNanchor_20_24"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_20_24" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> did not keep

sadden and weary us; of the confusion of Montaigne;<a name="FNanchor_22_26" id="FNanchor_22_26"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_22_26" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> that he
was quite aware of his want of method, and shunned it by
jumping from subject to subject; that he sought to be fashionable.</p>

<p>His foolish project of describing himself! And this not
casually and against his maxims, since every one makes mistakes,

As his book was not written with a religious purpose, he was
not bound to mention religion; but it is always our duty not to
turn men from it. One can excuse his rather free and licentious
opinions on some relations of life (730,231)<a name="FNanchor_29_33" id="FNanchor_29_33"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_29_33" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>; but one cannot
excuse his thoroughly pagan views on death, for a man must
renounce piety altogether, if he does not at least wish to die
like a Christian. Now, through the whole of his book his only
conception of death is a cowardly and effeminate one.</p>

leads us. If it be not true, there is no truth in man; and if it be
true, he finds therein great cause for humiliation, being compelled
to abase himself in one way or another. And since he
cannot exist without this knowledge, I wish that, before entering
on deeper researches into nature, he would consider her both
seriously and at leisure, that he would reflect upon himself also,
and knowing what proportion there is ...] Let man then
contemplate the whole of nature in her full and grand majesty,
and turn his vision from the low objects which surround him.
Let him gaze on that brilliant light, set like an eternal lamp to
illumine the universe; let the earth appear to him a point in
comparison with the vast circle described by the sun; and let
him wonder at the fact that this vast circle is itself but a very
fine point in comparison with that described by the stars in their
revolution round the firmament. But if our view be arrested
there, let our imagination pass beyond; it will sooner exhaust
the power of conception than nature that of supplying material
for conception. The whole visible world is only an imperceptible
atom in the ample bosom of nature. No idea approaches
it. We may enlarge our conceptions beyond all imaginable
space; we only produce atoms in comparison with the reality of
things. It is an infinite sphere, the centre of which is everywhere,
the circumference nowhere.<a name="FNanchor_30_34" id="FNanchor_30_34"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_30_34" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In short it is the greatest
sensible mark of the almighty power of God, that imagination
loses itself in that thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Returning to himself, let man consider what he is in comparison
with all existence; let him regard himself as lost in this
remote corner of nature; and from the little cell in which he
finds himself lodged, I mean the universe, let him estimate at
their true value the earth, kingdoms, cities, and himself. What
is a man in the Infinite?</p>

<p>But to show him another prodigy equally astonishing, let
him examine the most delicate things he knows. Let a mite
be given him, with its minute body and parts incomparably
more minute, limbs with their joints, veins in the limbs, blood
in the veins, humours in the blood, drops in the humours,
vapours in the drops. Dividing these last things again, let
him exhaust his powers of conception, and let the last object at
which he can arrive be now that of our discourse. Perhaps he
will think that here is the smallest point in nature. I will let
him see therein a new abyss. I will paint for him not only the
visible universe, but all that he can conceive of nature's immensity
in the womb of this abridged atom. Let him see
therein an infinity of universes, each of which has its firmament,
its planets, its earth, in the same proportion as in the visible
world; in each earth animals, and in the last mites, in which he
will find again all that the first had, finding still in these others
the same thing without end and without cessation. Let him
lose himself in wonders as amazing in their littleness as the
others in their vastness. For who will not be astounded at the
fact that our body, which a little while ago was imperceptible in
the universe, itself imperceptible in the bosom of the whole, is
now a colossus, a world, or rather a whole, in respect of the
nothingness which we cannot reach? He who regards himself
in this light will be afraid of himself, and observing himself
sustained in the body given him by nature between those
two abysses of the Infinite and Nothing, will tremble at
the sight of these marvels; and I think that, as his
curiosity changes into admiration, he will be more disposed
to contemplate them in silence than to examine them with
presumption.</p>

<p>For in fact what is man in nature? A Nothing in comparison
with the Infinite, an All in comparison with the Nothing, a
mean between nothing and everything. Since he is infinitely
removed from comprehending the extremes, the end of things
and their beginning are hopelessly hidden from him in an
impenetrable secret, he is equally incapable of seeing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Nothing from which he was made, and the Infinite in which he
is swallowed up.</p>

<p>What will he do then, but perceive the appearance of the
middle of things, in an eternal despair of knowing either their
beginning or their end. All things proceed from the Nothing,
and are borne towards the Infinite. Who will follow these
marvellous processes? The Author of these wonders understands
them. None other can do so.</p>

<p>Through failure to contemplate these Infinites, men have
rashly rushed into the examination of nature, as though they
bore some proportion to her. It is strange that they have
wished to understand the beginnings of things, and thence to
arrive at the knowledge of the whole, with a presumption as
infinite as their object. For surely this design cannot be
formed without presumption or without a capacity infinite
like nature.</p>

<p>If we are well informed, we understand that, as nature has
graven her image and that of her Author on all things, they
almost all partake of her double infinity. Thus we see that all
the sciences are infinite in the extent of their researches. For
who doubts that geometry, for instance, has an infinite infinity
of problems to solve? They are also infinite in the multitude
and fineness of their premises; for it is clear that those which are
put forward as ultimate are not self-supporting, but are based
on others which, again having others for their support, do
not permit of finality. But we represent some as ultimate for
reason, in the same way as in regard to material objects we
call that an indivisible point beyond which our senses can no
longer perceive anything, although by its nature it is infinitely
divisible.</p>

<p>Of these two Infinites of science, that of greatness is the most
palpable, and hence a few persons have pretended to know all
things. "I will speak of the whole,"<a name="FNanchor_31_35" id="FNanchor_31_35"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_31_35" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> said Democritus.</p>

<p>But the infinitely little is the least obvious. Philosophers
have much oftener claimed to have reached it, and it is here
they have all stumbled. This has given rise to such common
titles as <i>First Principles</i>, <i>Principles of Philosophy</i>,<a name="FNanchor_32_36" id="FNanchor_32_36"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_32_36" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and the like,
as ostentatious in fact, though not in appearance, as that one
which blinds us, <i>De omni scibili</i>.<a name="FNanchor_33_37" id="FNanchor_33_37"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_33_37" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>We naturally believe ourselves far more capable of reaching
the centre of things than of embracing their circumference.
The visible extent of the world visibly exceeds us; but as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
exceed little things, we think ourselves more capable of knowing
them. And yet we need no less capacity for attaining the
Nothing than the All. Infinite capacity is required for both,
and it seems to me that whoever shall have understood the
ultimate principles of being might also attain to the knowledge
of the Infinite. The one depends on the other, and one leads
to the other. These extremes meet and reunite by force of
distance, and find each other in God, and in God alone.</p>

<p>Let us then take our compass; we are something, and we are
not everything. The nature of our existence hides from us
the knowledge of first beginnings which are born of the Nothing;
and the littleness of our being conceals from us the sight of
the Infinite.</p>

<p>Our intellect holds the same position in the world of thought
as our body occupies in the expanse of nature.</p>

<p>Limited as we are in every way, this state which holds the
mean between two extremes is present in all our impotence.
Our senses perceive no extreme. Too much sound deafens us;
too much light dazzles us; too great distance or proximity
hinders our view. Too great length and too great brevity of
discourse tend to obscurity; too much truth is paralysing (I
know some who cannot understand that to take four from
nothing leaves nothing). First principles are too self-evident
for us; too much pleasure disagrees with us. Too many concords
are annoying in music; too many benefits irritate us; we wish
to have the wherewithal to over-pay our debts. <i>Beneficia eo
usque læta sunt dum videntur exsolvi posse; ubi multum antevenere,
pro gratia odium redditur.</i><a name="FNanchor_34_38" id="FNanchor_34_38"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_34_38" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> We feel neither extreme heat nor
extreme cold. Excessive qualities are prejudicial to us and not
perceptible by the senses; we do not feel but suffer them.
Extreme youth and extreme age hinder the mind, as also too
much and too little education. In short, extremes are for us
as though they were not, and we are not within their notice.
They escape us, or we them.</p>

<p>This is our true state; this is what makes us incapable of
certain knowledge and of absolute ignorance. We sail within
a vast sphere, ever drifting in uncertainty, driven from end to
end. When we think to attach ourselves to any point and to
fasten to it, it wavers and leaves us; and if we follow it, it
eludes our grasp, slips past us, and vanishes for ever. Nothing
stays for us. This is our natural condition, and yet most
contrary to our inclination; we burn with desire to find solid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
ground and an ultimate sure foundation whereon to build a
tower reaching to the Infinite. But our whole groundwork
cracks, and the earth opens to abysses.</p>

<p>Let us therefore not look for certainty and stability. Our
reason is always deceived by fickle shadows; nothing can fix
the finite between the two Infinites, which both enclose and
fly from it.</p>

<p>If this be well understood, I think that we shall remain at
rest, each in the state wherein nature has placed him. As this
sphere which has fallen to us as our lot is always distant from
either extreme, what matters it that man should have a little
more knowledge of the universe? If he has it, he but gets a
little higher. Is he not always infinitely removed from the
end, and is not the duration of our life equally removed from
eternity, even if it lasts ten years longer?</p>

<p>In comparison with these Infinites all finites are equal, and
I see no reason for fixing our imagination on one more than
on another. The only comparison which we make of ourselves
to the finite is painful to us.</p>

<p>If man made himself the first object of study, he would see
how incapable he is of going further. How can a part know
the whole? But he may perhaps aspire to know at least the
parts to which he bears some proportion. But the parts of the
world are all so related and linked to one another, that I believe it
impossible to know one without the other and without the whole.</p>

<p>Man, for instance, is related to all he knows. He needs a
place wherein to abide, time through which to live, motion in
order to live, elements to compose him, warmth and food to
nourish him, air to breathe. He sees light; he feels bodies;
in short, he is in a dependent alliance with everything. To
know man, then, it is necessary to know how it happens that
he needs air to live, and, to know the air, we must know how
it is thus related to the life of man, etc. Flame cannot exist
without air; therefore to understand the one, we must understand
the other.</p>

<p>Since everything then is cause and effect, dependent and
supporting, mediate and immediate, and all is held together by
a natural though imperceptible chain, which binds together
things most distant and most different, I hold it equally impossible
to know the parts without knowing the whole, and to
know the whole without knowing the parts in detail.</p>

<p>[The eternity of things in itself or in God must also astonish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
our brief duration. The fixed and constant immobility of
nature, in comparison with the continual change which goes on
within us, must have the same effect.]</p>

<p>And what completes our incapability of knowing things, is
the fact that they are simple, and that we are composed of two
opposite natures, different in kind, soul and body. For it is
impossible that our rational part should be other than spiritual;
and if any one maintain that we are simply corporeal, this
would far more exclude us from the knowledge of things, there
being nothing so inconceivable as to say that matter knows
itself. It is impossible to imagine how it should know itself.</p>

<p>So if we are simply material, we can know nothing at all;
and if we are composed of mind and matter, we cannot know
perfectly things which are simple, whether spiritual or corporeal.
Hence it comes that almost all philosophers have confused ideas
of things, and speak of material things in spiritual terms, and
of spiritual things in material terms. For they say boldly that
bodies have a tendency to fall, that they seek after their centre,
that they fly from destruction, that they fear the void, that they
have inclinations, sympathies, antipathies, all of which attributes
pertain only to mind. And in speaking of minds, they
consider them as in a place, and attribute to them movement
from one place to another; and these are qualities which belong
only to bodies.</p>

<p>Instead of receiving the ideas of these things in their purity,
we colour them with our own qualities, and stamp with our composite
being all the simple things which we contemplate.</p>

<p>Who would not think, seeing us compose all things of mind
and body, but that this mixture would be quite intelligible to
us? Yet it is the very thing we least understand. Man is
to himself the most wonderful object in nature; for he cannot
conceive what the body is, still less what the mind is, and
least of all how a body should be united to a mind. This is
the consummation of his difficulties, and yet it is his very
being. <i>Modus quo corporibus adhærent spiritus comprehendi ab
hominibus non potest, et hoc tamen homo est</i>.<a name="FNanchor_35_39" id="FNanchor_35_39"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_35_39" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Finally, to complete
the proof of our weakness, I shall conclude with these
two considerations....</p>


<h4><a name="p_73" id="p_73"></a>73</h4>

<p>[But perhaps this subject goes beyond the capacity of reason.
Let us therefore examine her solutions to problems within her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
powers. If there be anything to which her own interest must
have made her apply herself most seriously, it is the inquiry
into her own sovereign good. Let us see, then, wherein these
strong and clear-sighted souls have placed it, and whether
they agree.</p>

<p>One says that the sovereign good consists in virtue, another
in pleasure, another in the knowledge of nature, another in
truth, <i>Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_36_40" id="FNanchor_36_40"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_36_40" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> another in
total ignorance, another in indolence, others in disregarding
appearances, another in wondering at nothing, <i>nihil admirari
prope res una quæ possit facere et servare beatum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_37_41" id="FNanchor_37_41"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_37_41" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and the true
sceptics in their indifference, doubt, and perpetual suspense,
and others, wiser, think to find a better definition. We are
well satisfied.</p>

<p><i>To transpose after the laws to the following title.</i></p>

<p>We must see if this fine philosophy have gained nothing
certain from so long and so intent study; perhaps at least the
soul will know itself. Let us hear the rulers of the world on
this subject. What have they thought of her substance? 394.<a name="FNanchor_38_42" id="FNanchor_38_42"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_38_42" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
Have they been more fortunate in locating her? 395.<a name="FNanchor_39_43" id="FNanchor_39_43"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_39_43" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> What have
they found out about her origin, duration, and departure? 399.<a name="FNanchor_40_44" id="FNanchor_40_44"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_40_44" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Is then the soul too noble a subject for their feeble lights?
Let us then abase her to matter and see if she knows whereof
is made the very body which she animates, and those others
which she contemplates and moves at her will. What have
those great dogmatists, who are ignorant of nothing, known of
this matter? <i>Harum sententiarum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_41_45" id="FNanchor_41_45"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_41_45" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> 393.</p>

<p>This would doubtless suffice, if reason were reasonable. She
is reasonable enough to admit that she has been unable to
find anything durable, but she does not yet despair of reaching
it; she is as ardent as ever in this search, and is confident she
has within her the necessary powers for this conquest. We
must therefore conclude, and, after having examined her powers
in their effects, observe them in themselves, and see if she has
a nature and a grasp capable of laying hold of the truth.]</p>

lower, and make it appear ridiculous. To begin at the very
beginning.] What is more absurd than to say that lifeless
bodies have passions, fears, hatreds—that insensible bodies,
lifeless and incapable of life, have passions which presuppose
at least a sensitive soul to feel them, nay more, that the object
of their dread is the void? What is there in the void that
could make them afraid? Nothing is more shallow and ridiculous.
This is not all; it is said that they have in themselves
a source of movement to shun the void. Have they arms,
legs, muscles, nerves?</p>

<p>To write against those who made too profound a study of
science: Descartes.</p>


<h4><a name="p_77" id="p_77"></a>77</h4>

<p>I cannot forgive Descartes. In all his philosophy he would
have been quite willing to dispense with God. But he had to
make Him give a fillip to set the world in motion; beyond this,
he has no further need of God.</p>

and to compose the machine, is ridiculous. For it is useless,
uncertain, and painful. And were it true, we do not think all

<h4><a name="p_80" id="p_80"></a>80</h4>

<p>How comes it that a cripple does not offend us, but that a
fool does?<a name="FNanchor_45_49" id="FNanchor_45_49"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_45_49" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Because a cripple recognises that we walk straight,
whereas a fool declares that it is we who are silly; if it were not
so, we should feel pity and not anger.</p>

<p>Epictetus<a name="FNanchor_46_50" id="FNanchor_46_50"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_46_50" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> asks still more strongly: "Why are we not angry
if we are told that we have a headache, and why are we angry
if we are told that we reason badly, or choose wrongly?" The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
reason is that we are quite certain that we have not a headache,
or are not lame, but we are not so sure that we make a true choice.
So having assurance only because we see with our whole sight,
it puts us into suspense and surprise when another with his
whole sight sees the opposite, and still more so when a thousand
others deride our choice. For we must prefer our own lights
to those of so many others, and that is bold and difficult. There
is never this contradiction in the feelings towards a cripple.</p>


<h4><a name="p_81" id="p_81"></a>81</h4>

<p>It is natural for the mind to believe, and for the will to love;<a name="FNanchor_47_51" id="FNanchor_47_51"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_47_51" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
so that, for want of true objects, they must attach themselves
to false.</p>


<h4><a name="p_82" id="p_82"></a>82</h4>

<p><i>Imagination.</i><a name="FNanchor_48_52" id="FNanchor_48_52"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_48_52" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>—It is that deceitful part in man, that mistress
of error and falsity, the more deceptive that she is not always so;
for she would be an infallible rule of truth, if she were an infallible
rule of falsehood. But being most generally false, she
gives no sign of her nature, impressing the same character on
the true and the false.</p>

<p>I do not speak of fools, I speak of the wisest men; and it is
among them that the imagination has the great gift of persuasion.
Reason protests in vain; it cannot set a true value on things.</p>

<p>This arrogant power, the enemy of reason, who likes to rule
and dominate it, has established in man a second nature to show
how all-powerful she is. She makes men happy and sad, healthy
and sick, rich and poor; she compels reason to believe, doubt,
and deny; she blunts the senses, or quickens them; she has her
fools and sages; and nothing vexes us more than to see that she
fills her devotees with a satisfaction far more full and entire than
does reason. Those who have a lively imagination are a great
deal more pleased with themselves than the wise can reasonably
be. They look down upon men with haughtiness; they argue
with boldness and confidence, others with fear and diffidence;
and this gaiety of countenance often gives them the advantage
in the opinion of the hearers, such favour have the imaginary
wise in the eyes of judges of like nature. Imagination cannot
make fools wise; but she can make them happy, to the envy of
reason which can only make its friends miserable; the one covers
them with glory, the other with shame.</p>

<p>What but this faculty of imagination dispenses reputation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
awards respect and veneration to persons, works, laws, and the
great? How insufficient are all the riches of the earth without
her consent!</p>

<p>Would you not say that this magistrate, whose venerable age
commands the respect of a whole people, is governed by pure
and lofty reason, and that he judges causes according to their
true nature without considering those mere trifles which only
affect the imagination of the weak? See him go to sermon, full
of devout zeal, strengthening his reason with the ardour of his
love. He is ready to listen with exemplary respect. Let the
preacher appear, and let nature have given him a hoarse voice
or a comical cast of countenance, or let his barber have given
him a bad shave, or let by chance his dress be more dirtied than
usual, then however great the truths he announces. I wager our
senator loses his gravity.</p>

<p>If the greatest philosopher in the world find himself upon a
plank wider than actually necessary, but hanging over a precipice,
his imagination will prevail, though his reason convince
him of his safety.<a name="FNanchor_49_53" id="FNanchor_49_53"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_49_53" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Many cannot bear the thought without a
cold sweat. I will not state all its effects.</p>

<p>Every one knows that the sight of cats or rats, the crushing
of a coal, etc. may unhinge the reason. The tone of voice
affects the wisest, and changes the force of a discourse or a poem.</p>

<p>Love or hate alters the aspect of justice. How much greater
confidence has an advocate, retained with a large fee, in the
justice of his cause! How much better does his bold manner
make his case appear to the judges, deceived as they are by
appearances! How ludicrous is reason, blown with a breath in
every direction!</p>

<p>I should have to enumerate almost every action of men who
scarce waver save under her assaults. For reason has been
obliged to yield, and the wisest reason takes as her own principles
those which the imagination of man has everywhere rashly
introduced. [He who would follow reason only would be deemed
foolish by the generality of men. We must judge by the
opinion of the majority of mankind. Because it has pleased
them, we must work all day for pleasures seen to be imaginary;
and after sleep has refreshed our tired reason, we must forthwith
start up and rush after phantoms, and suffer the impressions
of this mistress of the world. This is one of the sources of error,
but it is not the only one.]</p>

<p>Our magistrates have known well this mystery. Their red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
robes, the ermine in which they wrap themselves like furry cats,<a name="FNanchor_50_54" id="FNanchor_50_54"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_50_54" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
the courts in which they administer justice, the <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>, and
all such august apparel were necessary; if the physicians had
not their cassocks and their mules, if the doctors had not their
square caps and their robes four times too wide, they would
never have duped the world, which cannot resist so original an
appearance. If magistrates had true justice, and if physicians
had the true art of healing, they would have no occasion for
square caps; the majesty of these sciences would of itself be
venerable enough. But having only imaginary knowledge,
they must employ those silly tools that strike the imagination
with which they have to deal; and thereby in fact they inspire
respect. Soldiers alone are not disguised in this manner,
because indeed their part is the most essential; they establish
themselves by force, the others by show.</p>

<p>Therefore our kings seek out no disguises. They do not
mask themselves in extraordinary costumes to appear such;
but they are accompanied by guards and halberdiers. Those
armed and red-faced puppets who have hands and power for
them alone, those trumpets and drums which go before them,
and those legions round about them, make the stoutest tremble.
They have not dress only, they have might. A very refined
reason is required to regard as an ordinary man the Grand
Turk, in his superb seraglio, surrounded by forty thousand
janissaries.</p>

<p>We cannot even see an advocate in his robe and with his
cap on his head, without a favourable opinion of his ability.
The imagination disposes of everything; it makes beauty,
justice, and happiness, which is everything in the world. I
should much like to see an Italian work, of which I only know
the title, which alone is worth many books, <i>Della opinione
regina del mondo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_51_55" id="FNanchor_51_55"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_51_55" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> I approve of the book without knowing it,
save the evil in it, if any. These are pretty much the effects of
that deceptive faculty, which seems to have been expressly
given us to lead us into necessary error. We have, however,
many other sources of error.</p>

<p>Not only are old impressions capable of misleading us; the
charms of novelty have the same power. Hence arise all the
disputes of men, who taunt each other either with following
the false impressions of childhood or with running rashly after
the new. Who keeps the due mean? Let him appear and
prove it. There is no principle, however natural to us from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
infancy, which may not be made to pass for a false impression
either of education or of sense.</p>

<p>"Because," say some, "you have believed from childhood
that a box was empty when you saw nothing in it, you have
believed in the possibility of a vacuum. This is an illusion of
your senses, strengthened by custom, which science must
correct." "Because," say others, "you have been taught at
school that there is no vacuum, you have perverted your common
sense which clearly comprehended it, and you must correct
this by returning to your first state." Which has deceived you,
your senses or your education?</p>

<p>We have another source of error in diseases.<a name="FNanchor_52_56" id="FNanchor_52_56"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_52_56" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> They spoil
the judgment and the senses; and if the more serious produce
a sensible change, I do not doubt that slighter ills produce a
proportionate impression.</p>

<p>Our own interest is again a marvellous instrument for nicely
putting out our eyes. The justest man in the world is not
allowed to be judge in his own cause; I know some who, in order
not to fall into this self-love, have been perfectly unjust out of
opposition. The sure way of losing a just cause has been to
get it recommended to these men by their near relatives.</p>

<p>Justice and truth are two such subtle points, that our tools
are too blunt to touch them accurately. If they reach the
point, they either crush it, or lean all round, more on the
false than on the true.</p>

<p>[Man is so happily formed that he has no ... good of the
true, and several excellent of the false. Let us now see how
much ... But the most powerful cause of error is the war
existing between the senses and reason.]</p>


<h4><a name="p_83" id="p_83"></a>83</h4>

<p><i>We must thus begin the chapter on the deceptive powers.</i>
Man is only a subject full of error, natural and ineffaceable,
without grace. Nothing shows him the truth. Everything
deceives him. These two sources of truth, reason and the
senses, besides being both wanting in sincerity, deceive each
other in turn. The senses mislead the reason with false
appearances, and receive from reason in their turn the same
trickery which they apply to her; reason has her revenge.
The passions of the soul trouble the senses, and make false
impressions upon them. They rival each other in falsehood
and deception.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_53_57" id="FNanchor_53_57"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_53_57" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>But besides those errors which arise accidentally and through
lack of intelligence, with these heterogeneous faculties ...</p>


<h4><a name="p_84" id="p_84"></a>84</h4>

<p>The imagination enlarges little objects so as to fill our souls
with a fantastic estimate; and, with rash insolence, it belittles
the great to its own measure, as when talking of God.</p>


<h4><a name="p_85" id="p_85"></a>85</h4>

<p>Things which have most hold on us, as the concealment
of our few possessions, are often a mere nothing. It is a nothing
which our imagination magnifies into a mountain. Another
turn of the imagination would make us discover this without
difficulty.</p>

<p>Children who are frightened at the face they have blackened
are but children. But how shall one who is so weak in his
childhood become really strong when he grows older? We
only change our fancies. All that is made perfect by progress
perishes also by progress. All that has been weak can never
become absolutely strong. We say in vain, "He has grown,
he has changed"; he is also the same.</p>


<h4><a name="p_89" id="p_89"></a>89</h4>

<p>Custom is our nature. He who is accustomed to the faith
believes in it, can no longer fear hell, and believes in nothing
else. He who is accustomed to believe that the king is terrible
... etc. Who doubts then that our soul, being accustomed to
see number, space, motion, believes that and nothing else?</p>


<h4><a name="p_90" id="p_90"></a>90</h4>

<p><i>Quod crebro videt non miratur, etiamsi cur fiat nescit; quod

<h4><a name="p_92" id="p_92"></a>92</h4>

<p>What are our natural principles but principles of custom?
In children they are those which they have received from the
habits of their fathers, as hunting in animals. A different
custom will cause different natural principles. This is seen in
experience; and if there are some natural principles ineradicable
by custom, there are also some customs opposed to nature,
ineradicable by nature, or by a second custom. This depends
on disposition.</p>


<h4><a name="p_93" id="p_93"></a>93</h4>

<p>Parents fear lest the natural love of their children may fade
away. What kind of nature is that which is subject to decay?

what is nature? For is custom not natural? I am much afraid
that nature is itself only a first custom, as custom is a second
nature.</p>

<p>There is nothing he may not make natural; there is nothing
natural he may not lose.</p>


<h4><a name="p_95" id="p_95"></a>95</h4>

<p>Memory, joy, are intuitions; and even mathematical propositions
become intuitions, for education produces natural
intuitions, and natural intuitions are erased by education.</p>


<h4><a name="p_96" id="p_96"></a>96</h4>

<p>When we are accustomed to use bad reasons for proving
natural effects, we are not willing to receive good reasons when
they are discovered. An example may be given from the
circulation of the blood as a reason why the vein swells below
the ligature.</p>


<h4><a name="p_97" id="p_97"></a>97</h4>

<p>The most important affair in life is the choice of a calling;
chance decides it. Custom makes men masons, soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
slaters. "He is a good slater," says one, and, speaking of
soldiers, remarks, "They are perfect fools." But others affirm,
"There is nothing great but war, the rest of men are good for
nothing." We choose our callings according as we hear this
or that praised or despised in our childhood, for we naturally
love truth and hate folly. These words move us; the only
error is in their application. So great is the force of custom
that out of those whom nature has only made men, are created
all conditions of men. For some districts are full of masons,
others of soldiers, etc. Certainly nature is not so uniform.
It is custom then which does this, for it constrains nature.
But sometimes nature gains the ascendancy, and preserves
man's instinct, in spite of all custom, good or bad.</p>


<h4><a name="p_98" id="p_98"></a>98</h4>

<p><i>Bias leading to error.</i>—It is a deplorable thing to see all men
deliberating on means alone, and not on the end. Each thinks
how he will acquit himself in his condition; but as for the choice
of condition, or of country, chance gives them to us.</p>

<p>It is a pitiable thing to see so many Turks, heretics, and infidels
follow the way of their fathers for the sole reason that each has

<p>There is an universal and essential difference between the
actions of the will and all other actions.</p>

<p>The will is one of the chief factors in belief, not that it creates
belief, but because things are true or false according to the
aspect in which we look at them. The will, which prefers one
aspect to another, turns away the mind from considering the
qualities of all that it does not like to see; and thus the mind,
moving in accord with the will, stops to consider the aspect
which it likes, and so judges by what it sees.</p>


<h4><a name="p_100" id="p_100"></a>100</h4>

<p><i>Self-love.</i>—The nature of self-love and of this human Ego is
to love self only and consider self only. But what will man do?
He cannot prevent this object that he loves from being full of
faults and wants. He wants to be great, and he sees himself
small. He wants to be happy, and he sees himself miserable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
He wants to be perfect, and he sees himself full of imperfections.
He wants to be the object of love and esteem among men, and
he sees that his faults merit only their hatred and contempt.
This embarrassment in which he finds himself produces in him
the most unrighteous and criminal passion that can be imagined;
for he conceives a mortal enmity against that truth which
reproves him, and which convinces him of his faults. He
would annihilate it, but, unable to destroy it in its essence, he
destroys it as far as possible in his own knowledge and in that
of others; that is to say, he devotes all his attention to hiding
his faults both from others and from himself, and he cannot
endure either that others should point them out to him, or that
they should see them.</p>

<p>Truly it is an evil to be full of faults; but it is a still greater
evil to be full of them, and to be unwilling to recognise
them, since that is to add the further fault of a voluntary
illusion. We do not like others to deceive us; we do not think
it fair that they should be held in higher esteem by us than they
deserve; it is not then fair that we should deceive them, and
should wish them to esteem us more highly than we deserve.</p>

<p>Thus, when they discover only the imperfections and vices
which we really have, it is plain they do us no wrong, since it is
not they who cause them; they rather do us good, since they
help us to free ourselves from an evil, namely, the ignorance of
these imperfections. We ought not to be angry at their knowing
our faults and despising us; it is but right that they should
know us for what we are, and should despise us, if we are
contemptible.</p>

<p>Such are the feelings that would arise in a heart full of equity
and justice. What must we say then of our own heart, when
we see in it a wholly different disposition? For is it not true
that we hate truth and those who tell it us, and that we like
them to be deceived in our favour, and prefer to be esteemed by
them as being other than what we are in fact? One proof of
this makes me shudder. The Catholic religion does not bind
us to confess our sins indiscriminately to everybody; it allows
them to remain hidden from all other men save one, to whom
she bids us reveal the innermost recesses of our heart, and show
ourselves as we are. There is only this one man in the world
whom she orders us to undeceive, and she binds him to an
inviolable secrecy, which makes this knowledge to him as if
it were not. Can we imagine anything more charitable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
pleasant? And yet the corruption of man is such that he finds
even this law harsh; and it is one of the main reasons which
has caused a great part of Europe to rebel against the Church.<a name="FNanchor_61_65" id="FNanchor_61_65"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_61_65" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>How unjust and unreasonable is the heart of man, which
feels it disagreeable to be obliged to do in regard to one man
what in some measure it were right to do to all men! For is
it right that we should deceive men?</p>

<p>There are different degrees in this aversion to truth; but all
may perhaps be said to have it in some degree, because it is
inseparable from self-love. It is this false delicacy which makes
those who are under the necessity of reproving others choose so
many windings and middle courses to avoid offence. They
must lessen our faults, appear to excuse them, intersperse
praises and evidence of love and esteem. Despite all this, the
medicine does not cease to be bitter to self-love. It takes as
little as it can, always with disgust, and often with a secret
spite against those who administer it.</p>

<p>Hence it happens that if any have some interest in being
loved by us, they are averse to render us a service which they
know to be disagreeable. They treat us as we wish to be treated.
We hate the truth, and they hide it from us. We desire flattery,
and they flatter us. We like to be deceived, and they deceive us.</p>

<p>So each degree of good fortune which raises us in the world
removes us farther from truth, because we are most afraid of
wounding those whose affection is most useful and whose dislike
is most dangerous. A prince may be the byword of all Europe,
and he alone will know nothing of it. I am not astonished.
To tell the truth is useful to those to whom it is spoken, but
disadvantageous to those who tell it, because it makes them
disliked. Now those who live with princes love their own
interests more than that of the prince whom they serve; and so
they take care not to confer on him a benefit so as to injure
themselves.</p>

<p>This evil is no doubt greater and more common among the
higher classes; but the lower are not exempt from it, since there
is always some advantage in making men love us. Human life
is thus only a perpetual illusion; men deceive and flatter each
other. No one speaks of us in our presence as he does of us in
our absence. Human society is founded on mutual deceit;
few friendships would endure if each knew what his friend said
of him in his absence, although he then spoke in sincerity and
without passion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Man is then only disguise, falsehood, and hypocrisy, both in
himself and in regard to others. He does not wish any one to
tell him the truth; he avoids telling it to others, and all these
dispositions, so removed from justice and reason, have a natural
root in his heart.</p>

<p>I set it down as a fact that if all men knew what each said of

<p>The example of Alexander's chastity<a name="FNanchor_62_66" id="FNanchor_62_66"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_62_66" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> has not made so many
continent as that of his drunkenness has made intemperate.
It is not shameful not to be as virtuous as he, and it seems
excusable to be no more vicious. We do not believe ourselves
to be exactly sharing in the vices of the vulgar, when we see
that we are sharing in those of great men; and yet we do not
observe that in these matters they are ordinary men. We hold
on to them by the same end by which they hold on to the rabble;
for, however exalted they are, they are still united at some point
to the lowest of men. They are not suspended in the air, quite
removed from our society. No, no; if they are greater than we,
it is because their heads are higher; but their feet are as low as
ours. They are all on the same level, and rest on the same
earth; and by that extremity they are as low as we are, as the
meanest folk, as infants, and as the beasts.</p>


<h4><a name="p_104" id="p_104"></a>104</h4>

<p>When our passion leads us to do something, we forget our
duty; for example, we like a book and read it, when we ought
to be doing something else. Now, to remind ourselves of our
duty, we must set ourselves a task we dislike; we then plead that
we have something else to do, and by this means remember
our duty.</p>

<p>How difficult it is to submit anything to the judgment of
another, without prejudicing his judgment by the manner in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
which we submit it! If we say, "I think it beautiful," "I think
it obscure," or the like, we either entice the imagination into that
view, or irritate it to the contrary. It is better to say nothing;
and then the other judges according to what really is, that is to
say, according as it then is, and according as the other circumstances,
not of our making, have placed it. But we at least
shall have added nothing, unless it be that silence also produces
an effect, according to the turn and the interpretation which
the other will be disposed to give it, or as he will guess it from
gestures or countenance, or from the tone of the voice, if he is a
physiognomist. So difficult is it not to upset a judgment
from its natural place, or, rather, so rarely is it firm and stable!</p>


<h4><a name="p_106" id="p_106"></a>106</h4>

<p>When we are well we wonder what we would do if we were ill,
but when we are ill we take medicine cheerfully; the illness
persuades us to do so. We have no longer the passions and
desires for amusements and promenades which health gave to
us, but which are incompatible with the necessities of illness.
Nature gives us, then, passions and desires suitable to our
present state.<a name="FNanchor_64_68" id="FNanchor_64_68"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_64_68" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> We are only troubled by the fears which we,
and not nature, give ourselves, for they add to the state in which
we are the passions of the state in which we are not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>As nature makes us always unhappy in every state, our
desires picture to us a happy state; because they add to the
state in which we are the pleasures of the state in which we are
not. And if we attained to these pleasures, we should not be
happy after all; because we should have other desires natural
to this new state.</p>

<p>We must particularise this general proposition....</p>


<h4><a name="p_110" id="p_110"></a>110</h4>

<p>The consciousness of the falsity of present pleasures, and the

<p><i>Inconstancy.</i>—Things have different qualities, and the soul

two bunches exactly the same, and has a bunch two
grapes alike? etc.</p>

he be the head, the heart, the stomach, the veins, each vein,

<p>A town, a country-place, is from afar a town and a country-place.
But, as we draw near, there are houses, trees, tiles,

soon as it comes, we are satiated. It is the same in play, and
the same in the search for truth. In disputes we like to see the
clash of opinions, but not at all to contemplate truth when
found. To observe it with pleasure, we have to see it emerge
out of strife. So in the passions, there is pleasure in seeing the
collision of two contraries; but when one acquires the mastery,
it becomes only brutality. We never seek things for themselves,
but for the search. Likewise in plays, scenes which do not
rouse the emotion of fear are worthless, so are extreme and
hopeless misery, brutal lust, and extreme cruelty.</p>

<p><i>Diversion.</i>—When I have occasionally set myself to consider
the different distractions of men, the pains and perils to which
they expose themselves at court or in war, whence arise so many
quarrels, passions, bold and often bad ventures, etc., I have
discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one
single fact, that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber.
A man who has enough to live on, if he knew how to stay with
pleasure at home, would not leave it to go to sea or to besiege
a town. A commission in the army would not be bought so
dearly, but that it is found insufferable not to budge from the
town; and men only seek conversation and entering games,
because they cannot remain with pleasure at home.</p>

<p>But on further consideration, when, after finding the cause
of all our ills, I have sought to discover the reason of it, I have
found that there is one very real reason, namely, the natural
poverty of our feeble and mortal condition, so miserable that
nothing can comfort us when we think of it closely.</p>

<p>Whatever condition we picture to ourselves, if we muster all
the good things which it is possible to possess, royalty is the
finest position in the world. Yet, when we imagine a king
attended with every pleasure he can feel, if he be without
diversion, and be left to consider and reflect on what he is, this
feeble happiness will not sustain him; he will necessarily fall
into forebodings of dangers, of revolutions which may happen,
and, finally, of death and inevitable disease; so that if he be
without what is called diversion, he is unhappy, and more
unhappy than the least of his subjects who plays and diverts
himself.</p>

<p>Hence it comes that play and the society of women, war, and
high posts, are so sought after. Not that there is in fact any
happiness in them, or that men imagine true bliss to consist in
money won at play, or in the hare which they hunt; we would
not take these as a gift. We do not seek that easy and peaceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
lot which permits us to think of our unhappy condition, nor
the dangers of war, nor the labour of office, but the bustle which
averts these thoughts of ours, and amuses us.</p>

<p>Reasons why we like the chase better than the quarry.</p>

<p>Hence it comes that men so much love noise and stir; hence
it comes that the prison is so horrible a punishment; hence it
comes that the pleasure of solitude is a thing incomprehensible.
And it is in fact the greatest source of happiness in the condition
of kings, that men try incessantly to divert them, and to procure
for them all kinds of pleasures.</p>

<p>The king is surrounded by persons whose only thought is to
divert the king, and to prevent his thinking of self. For he is
unhappy, king though he be, if he think of himself.</p>

<p>This is all that men have been able to discover to make
themselves happy. And those who philosophise on the matter,
and who think men unreasonable for spending a whole day in
chasing a hare which they would not have bought, scarce know
our nature. The hare in itself would not screen us from the sight
of death and calamities; but the chase which turns away our
attention from these, does screen us.</p>

<p>The advice given to Pyrrhus to take the rest which he was
about to seek with so much labour, was full of difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_69_73" id="FNanchor_69_73"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_69_73" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>[To bid a man live quietly is to bid him live happily. It is
to advise him to be in a state perfectly happy, in which he can
think at leisure without finding therein a cause of distress. This
is to misunderstand nature.</p>

<p>As men who naturally understand their own condition avoid
nothing so much as rest, so there is nothing they leave undone
in seeking turmoil. Not that they have an instinctive knowledge
of true happiness ...</p>

<p>So we are wrong in blaming them. Their error does not lie
in seeking excitement, if they seek it only as a diversion; the
evil is that they seek it as if the possession of the objects of their
quest would make them really happy. In this respect it is right
to call their quest a vain one. Hence in all this both the
censurers and the censured do not understand man's true nature.]</p>

<p>And thus, when we take the exception against them, that
what they seek with such fervour cannot satisfy them, if they
replied—as they should do if they considered the matter
thoroughly—that they sought in it only a violent and impetuous
occupation which turned their thoughts from self, and that they
therefore chose an attractive object to charm and ardently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
attract them, they would leave their opponents without a reply.
But they do not make this reply, because they do not know
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_70_74" id="FNanchor_70_74"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_70_74" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> They do not know that it is the chase, and not the
quarry, which they seek.</p>

<p>Dancing: we must consider rightly where to place our feet.—A
gentleman sincerely believes that hunting is great and royal
sport; but a beater is not of this opinion.</p>

<p>They imagine that if they obtained such a post, they would
then rest with pleasure, and are insensible of the insatiable
nature of their desire. They think they are truly seeking quiet,
and they are only seeking excitement.</p>

<p>They have a secret instinct which impels them to seek amusement
and occupation abroad, and which arises from the sense of
their constant unhappiness. They have another secret instinct,
a remnant of the greatness of our original nature, which teaches
them that happiness in reality consists only in rest, and not in
stir. And of these two contrary instincts they form within
themselves a confused idea, which hides itself from their view
in the depths of their soul, inciting them to aim at rest through
excitement, and always to fancy that the satisfaction which they
have not will come to them, if, by surmounting whatever
difficulties confront them, they can thereby open the door to rest.</p>

<p>Thus passes away all man's life. Men seek rest in a struggle
against difficulties; and when they have conquered these, rest
becomes insufferable. For we think either of the misfortunes
we have or of those which threaten us. And even if we should
see ourselves sufficiently sheltered on all sides, weariness of its
own accord would not fail to arise from the depths of the heart
wherein it has its natural roots, and to fill the mind with its
poison.</p>

<p>Thus so wretched is man that he would weary even without
any cause for weariness from the peculiar state of his disposition;
and so frivolous is he, that, though full of a thousand reasons for
weariness, the least thing, such as playing billiards or hitting a
ball, is sufficient to amuse him.</p>

<p>But will you say what object has he in all this? The pleasure
of bragging to-morrow among his friends that he has played
better than another. So others sweat in their own rooms to
show to the learned that they have solved a problem in algebra,
which no one had hitherto been able to solve. Many more
expose themselves to extreme perils, in my opinion as foolishly,
in order to boast afterwards that they have captured a town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Lastly, others wear themselves out in studying all these things,
not in order to become wiser, but only in order to prove that
they know them; and these are the most senseless of the band,
since they are so knowingly, whereas one may suppose of the
others, that if they knew it, they would no longer be foolish.</p>

<p>This man spends his life without weariness in playing every
day for a small stake. Give him each morning the money he
can win each day, on condition he does not play; you make him
miserable. It will perhaps be said that he seeks the amusement
of play and not the winnings. Make him then play for
nothing; he will not become excited over it, and will feel bored.
It is then not the amusement alone that he seeks; a languid and
passionless amusement will weary him. He must get excited
over it, and deceive himself by the fancy that he will be happy to
win what he would not have as a gift on condition of not playing;
and he must make for himself an object of passion, and excite
over it his desire, his anger, his fear, to obtain his imagined end,
as children are frightened at the face they have blackened.</p>

<p>Whence comes it that this man, who lost his only son a few
months ago, or who this morning was in such trouble through
being distressed by lawsuits and quarrels, now no longer thinks
of them? Do not wonder; he is quite taken up in looking out
for the boar which his dogs have been hunting so hotly for the
last six hours. He requires nothing more. However full of
sadness a man may be, he is happy for the time, if you can
prevail upon him to enter into some amusement; and however
happy a man may be, he will soon be discontented and wretched,
if he be not diverted and occupied by some passion or pursuit
which prevents weariness from overcoming him. Without
amusement there is no joy; with amusement there is no sadness.
And this also constitutes the happiness of persons in high
position, that they have a number of people to amuse them, and
have the power to keep themselves in this state.</p>

<p>Consider this. What is it to be superintendent, chancellor,
first president, but to be in a condition wherein from early
morning a large number of people come from all quarters to see
them, so as not to leave them an hour in the day in which they
can think of themselves? And when they are in disgrace and
sent back to their country houses, where they lack neither
wealth nor servants to help them on occasion, they do not fail
to be wretched and desolate, because no one prevents them from
thinking of themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_140" id="p_140"></a>140</h4>

<p>[How does it happen that this man, so distressed at the death
of his wife and his only son, or who has some great lawsuit
which annoys him, is not at this moment sad, and that he seems
so free from all painful and disquieting thoughts? We need not
wonder; for a ball has been served him, and he must return it
to his companion. He is occupied in catching it in its fall from
the roof, to win a game. How can he think of his own affairs,
pray, when he has this other matter in hand? Here is a care
worthy of occupying this great soul, and taking away from him
every other thought of the mind. This man, born to know the
universe, to judge all causes, to govern a whole state, is altogether
occupied and taken up with the business of catching a
hare. And if he does not lower himself to this, and wants
always to be on the strain, he will be more foolish still, because
he would raise himself above humanity; and after all he is only
a man, that is to say capable of little and of much, of all and of
nothing; he is neither angel nor brute, but man.]</p>

<p>Men spend their time in following a ball or a hare; it is the
pleasure even of kings.</p>


<h4><a name="p_142" id="p_142"></a>142</h4>

<p><i>Diversion.</i>—Is not the royal dignity sufficiently great in
itself to make its possessor happy by the mere contemplation
of what he is? Must he be diverted from this thought like
ordinary folk? I see well that a man is made happy by diverting
him from the view of his domestic sorrows so as to occupy all
his thoughts with the care of dancing well. But will it be the
same with a king, and will he be happier in the pursuit of these
idle amusements than in the contemplation of his greatness?
And what more satisfactory object could be presented to his
mind? Would it not be a deprivation of his delight for him to
occupy his soul with the thought of how to adjust his steps to
the cadence of an air, or of how to throw a [ball] skilfully,
instead of leaving it to enjoy quietly the contemplation of the
majestic glory which encompasses him? Let us make the trial;
let us leave a king all alone to reflect on himself quite at leisure,
without any gratification of the senses, without any care in his
mind, without society; and we will see that a king without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
diversion is a man full of wretchedness. So this is carefully
avoided, and near the persons of kings there never fail to be a
great number of people who see to it that amusement follows
business, and who watch all the time of their leisure to supply
them with delights and games, so that there is no blank in it.
In fact, kings are surrounded with persons who are wonderfully
attentive in taking care that the king be not alone and in a state
to think of himself, knowing well that he will be miserable, king
though he be, if he meditate on self.</p>

<p>In all this I am not talking of Christian kings as Christians,
but only as kings.</p>


<h4><a name="p_143" id="p_143"></a>143</h4>

<p><i>Diversion.</i>—Men are entrusted from infancy with the care of
their honour, their property, their friends, and even with the
property and the honour of their friends. They are overwhelmed
with business, with the study of languages, and with
physical exercise;<a name="FNanchor_71_75" id="FNanchor_71_75"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_71_75" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and they are made to understand that they
cannot be happy unless their health, their honour, their fortune
and that of their friends be in good condition, and that a single
thing wanting will make them unhappy. Thus they are given
cares and business which make them bustle about from break of
day.—It is, you will exclaim, a strange way to make them happy!
What more could be done to make them miserable?—Indeed!
what could be done? We should only have to relieve them from
all these cares; for then they would see themselves: they would
reflect on what they are, whence they came, whither they go,
and thus we cannot employ and divert them too much. And
this is why, after having given them so much business, we
advise them, if they have some time for relaxation, to employ
it in amusement, in play, and to be always fully occupied.</p>

<p>How hollow and full of ribaldry is the heart of man!</p>

<p>I spent a long time in the study of the abstract sciences, and
was disheartened by the small number of fellow-students in
them. When I commenced the study of man, I saw that these
abstract sciences are not suited to man, and that I was wandering
farther from my own state in examining them, than others in
not knowing them. I pardoned their little knowledge; but I
thought at least to find many companions in the study of man,
and that it was the true study which is suited to him. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
been deceived; still fewer study it than geometry. It is only
from the want of knowing how to study this that we seek the
other studies. But is it not that even here is not the knowledge
which man should have, and that for the purpose of happiness
it is better for him not to know himself?</p>

<p>Man is obviously made to think. It is his whole dignity and

<p>We do not content ourselves with the life we have in ourselves

labour unceasingly to adorn and preserve this imaginary
existence, and neglect the real. And if we possess calmness,
or generosity, or truthfulness, we are eager to make it known,
so as to attach these virtues to that imaginary existence. We
would rather separate them from ourselves to join them to it;
and we would willingly be cowards in order to acquire the
reputation of being brave. A great proof of the nothingness
of our being, not to be satisfied with the one without the other,
and to renounce the one for the other! For he would be infamous

speak of them; and these will not even speak well of them if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>

<p>Sneezing absorbs all the functions of the soul, as well as
work does; but we do not draw therefrom the same conclusions
against the greatness of man, because it is against his will. And
although we bring it on ourselves, it is nevertheless against our
will that we sneeze. It is not in view of the act itself; it is for
another end. And thus it is not a proof of the weakness of man,
and of his slavery under that action.</p>

<p>It is not disgraceful for man to yield to pain, and it is disgraceful
to yield to pleasure. This is not because pain comes
to us from without, and we ourselves seek pleasure; for it is
possible to seek pain, and yield to it purposely, without this
kind of baseness. Whence comes it, then, that reason thinks
it honourable to succumb under stress of pain, and disgraceful
to yield to the attack of pleasure? It is because pain does not
tempt and attract us. It is we ourselves who choose it voluntarily,
and will it to prevail over us. So that we are masters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the situation; and in this man yields to himself. But in pleasure
it is man who yields to pleasure. Now only mastery and

disturbed by a thousand accidents, which bring inevitable griefs.</p>

<p><i>Misery.</i>—The only thing which consoles us for our miseries

ours, and do not think of the only one which belongs to us; and
so idle are we that we dream of those times which are no more,
and thoughtlessly overlook that which alone exists. For the
present is generally painful to us. We conceal it from our sight,
because it troubles us; and if it be delightful to us, we regret to
see it pass away. We try to sustain it by the future, and think
of arranging matters which are not in our power, for a time
which we have no certainty of reaching.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>... Let them at least learn what is the religion they attack,
before attacking it. If this religion boasted of having a clear
view of God, and of possessing it open and unveiled, it would be
attacking it to say that we see nothing in the world which shows
it with this clearness. But since, on the contrary, it says that
men are in darkness and estranged from God, that He has
hidden Himself from their knowledge, that this is in fact the
name which He gives Himself in the Scriptures, <i>Deus absconditus</i>;<a name="FNanchor_86_90" id="FNanchor_86_90"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_86_90" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
and finally, if it endeavours equally to establish these two
things: that God has set up in the Church visible signs to make
Himself known to those who should seek Him sincerely, and
that He has nevertheless so disguised them that He will only be
perceived by those who seek Him with all their heart; what
advantage can they obtain, when, in the negligence with which
they make profession of being in search of the truth, they cry
out that nothing reveals it to them; and since that darkness in
which they are, and with which they upbraid the Church,
establishes only one of the things which she affirms, without
touching the other, and, very far from destroying, proves her
doctrine?</p>

<p>In order to attack it, they should have protested that they had
made every effort to seek Him everywhere, and even in that
which the Church proposes for their instruction, but without
satisfaction. If they talked in this manner, they would in
truth be attacking one of her pretensions. But I hope here to
show that no reasonable person can speak thus, and I venture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
even to say that no one has ever done so. We know well
enough how those who are of this mind behave. They believe
they have made great efforts for their instruction, when they
have spent a few hours in reading some book of Scripture, and
have questioned some priest on the truths of the faith. After
that, they boast of having made vain search in books and among
men. But, verily, I will tell them what I have often said, that
this negligence is insufferable. We are not here concerned
with the trifling interests of some stranger, that we should treat
it in this fashion; the matter concerns ourselves and our all.</p>

<p>The immortality of the soul is a matter which is of so great
consequence to us, and which touches us so profoundly, that we
must have lost all feeling to be indifferent as to knowing what
it is. All our actions and thoughts must take such different
courses, according as there are or are not eternal joys to hope
for, that it is impossible to take one step with sense and judgment,
unless we regulate our course by our view of this point
which ought to be our ultimate end.</p>

<p>Thus our first interest and our first duty is to enlighten ourselves
on this subject, whereon depends all our conduct. Therefore
among those who do not believe, I make a vast difference
between those who strive with all their power to inform themselves,
and those who live without troubling or thinking about it.</p>

<p>I can have only compassion for those who sincerely bewail
their doubt, who regard it as the greatest of misfortunes, and
who, sparing no effort to escape it, make of this inquiry their
principal and most serious occupations.</p>

<p>But as for those who pass their life without thinking of this
ultimate end of life, and who, for this sole reason that they do
not find within themselves the lights which convince them of it,
neglect to seek them elsewhere, and to examine thoroughly
whether this opinion is one of those which people receive with
credulous simplicity, or one of those which, although obscure in
themselves, have nevertheless a solid and immovable foundation,
I look upon them in a manner quite different.</p>

<p>This carelessness in a matter which concerns themselves,
their eternity, their all, moves me more to anger than pity; it
astonishes and shocks me; it is to me monstrous. I do not say
this out of the pious zeal of a spiritual devotion. I expect, on
the contrary, that we ought to have this feeling from principles
of human interest and self-love; for this we need only see what
the least enlightened persons see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>We do not require great education of the mind to understand
that here is no real and lasting satisfaction; that our pleasures
are only vanity; that our evils are infinite; and, lastly, that
death, which threatens us every moment, must infallibly place
us within a few years under the dreadful necessity of being for
ever either annihilated or unhappy.</p>

<p>There is nothing more real than this, nothing more terrible.
Be we as heroic as we like, that is the end which awaits the noblest
life in the world. Let us reflect on this, and then say whether
it is not beyond doubt that there is no good in this life but in the
hope of another; that we are happy only in proportion as we
draw near it; and that, as there are no more woes for those who
have complete assurance of eternity, so there is no more happiness
for those who have no insight into it.</p>

<p>Surely then it is a great evil thus to be in doubt, but it is at
least an indispensable duty to seek when we are in such doubt;
and thus the doubter who does not seek is altogether completely
unhappy and completely wrong. And if besides this he is easy
and content, professes to be so, and indeed boasts of it; if it is this
state itself which is the subject of his joy and vanity, I have no
words to describe so silly a creature.</p>

<p>How can people hold these opinions? What joy can we find
in the expectation of nothing but hopeless misery? What
reason for boasting that we are in impenetrable darkness?
And how can it happen that the following argument occurs to
a reasonable man?</p>

<p>"I know not who put me into the world, nor what the world
is, nor what I myself am. I am in terrible ignorance of everything.
I know not what my body is, nor my senses, nor my
soul, not even that part of me which thinks what I say, which
reflects on all and on itself, and knows itself no more than the
rest. I see those frightful spaces of the universe which surround
me, and I find myself tied to one corner of this vast expanse,
without knowing why I am put in this place rather than in
another, nor why the short time which is given me to live is
assigned to me at this point rather than at another of the whole
eternity which was before me or which shall come after me. I
see nothing but infinites on all sides, which surround me as an
atom, and as a shadow which endures only for an instant and
returns no more. All I know is that I must soon die, but what
I know least is this very death which I cannot escape.</p>

<p>"As I know not whence I come, so I know not whither I go.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
I know only that, in leaving this world, I fall for ever either
into annihilation or into the hands of an angry God, without
knowing to which of these two states I shall be for ever assigned.
Such is my state, full of weakness and uncertainty. And from
all this I conclude that I ought to spend all the days of my life
without caring to inquire into what must happen to me. Perhaps
I might find some solution to my doubts, but I will not
take the trouble, nor take a step to seek it; and after treating
with scorn those who are concerned with this care, I will go
without foresight and without fear to try the great event, and
let myself be led carelessly to death, uncertain of the eternity
of my future state."</p>

<p>Who would desire to have for a friend a man who talks in this
fashion? Who would choose him out from others to tell him
of his affairs? Who would have recourse to him in affliction?
And indeed to what use in life could one put him?</p>

<p>In truth, it is the glory of religion to have for enemies men so
unreasonable: and their opposition to it is so little dangerous
that it serves on the contrary to establish its truths. For the
Christian faith goes mainly to establish these two facts, the
corruption of nature, and redemption by Jesus Christ. Now I
contend that if these men do not serve to prove the truth of the
redemption by the holiness of their behaviour, they at least
serve admirably to show the corruption of nature by sentiments
so unnatural.</p>

<p>Nothing is so important to man as his own state, nothing is
so formidable to him as eternity; and thus it is not natural that
there should be men indifferent to the loss of their existence, and
to the perils of everlasting suffering. They are quite different
with regard to all other things. They are afraid of mere trifles;
they foresee them; they feel them. And this same man who
spends so many days and nights in rage and despair for the loss
of office, or for some imaginary insult to his honour, is the very
one who knows without anxiety and without emotion that he
will lose all by death. It is a monstrous thing to see in the
same heart and at the same time this sensibility to trifles and
this strange insensibility to the greatest objects. It is an
incomprehensible enchantment, and a supernatural slumber,
which indicates as its cause an all-powerful force.</p>

<p>There must be a strange confusion in the nature of man, that
he should boast of being in that state in which it seems incredible
that a single individual should be. However, experience has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
shown me so great a number of such persons that the fact would
be surprising, if we did not know that the greater part of those
who trouble themselves about the matter are disingenuous, and
not in fact what they say. They are people who have heard it
said that it is the fashion to be thus daring. It is what they
call shaking off the yoke, and they try to imitate this. But it
would not be difficult to make them understand how greatly
they deceive themselves in thus seeking esteem. This is not
the way to gain it, even I say among those men of the world
who take a healthy view of things, and who know that the only
way to succeed in this life is to make ourselves appear honourable,
faithful, judicious, and capable of useful service to a friend;
because naturally men love only what may be useful to them.
Now, what do we gain by hearing it said of a man that he has
now thrown off the yoke, that he does not believe there is a God
who watches our actions, that he considers himself the sole
master of his conduct, and that he thinks he is accountable for
it only to himself? Does he think that he has thus brought us
to have henceforth complete confidence in him, and to look to
him for consolation, advice, and help in every need of life? Do
they profess to have delighted us by telling us that they hold
our soul to be only a little wind and smoke, especially by telling
us this in a haughty and self-satisfied tone of voice? Is this a
thing to say gaily? Is it not, on the contrary, a thing to say
sadly, as the saddest thing in the world?</p>

<p>If they thought of it seriously, they would see that this is so
bad a mistake, so contrary to good sense, so opposed to decency
and so removed in every respect from that good breeding which
they seek, that they would be more likely to correct than to
pervert those who had an inclination to follow them. And
indeed, make them give an account of their opinions, and of the
reasons which they have for doubting religion, and they will
say to you things so feeble and so petty, that they will persuade
you of the contrary. The following is what a person one day
said to such a one very appositely: "If you continue to talk
in this manner, you will really make me religious." And he
was right, for who would not have a horror of holding opinions in
which he would have such contemptible persons as companions!</p>

<p>Thus those who only feign these opinions would be very
unhappy, if they restrained their natural feelings in order to
make themselves the most conceited of men. If, at the bottom
of their heart, they are troubled at not having more light, let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
them not disguise the fact; this avowal will not be shameful.
The only shame is to have none. Nothing reveals more an
extreme weakness of mind than not to know the misery of a
godless man. Nothing is more indicative of a bad disposition of
heart than not to desire the truth of eternal promises. Nothing
is more dastardly than to act with bravado before God. Let
them then leave these impieties to those who are sufficiently ill-bred
to be really capable of them. Let them at least be honest
men, if they cannot be Christians. Finally, let them recognise
that there are two kinds of people one can call reasonable; those
who serve God with all their heart because they know Him, and
those who seek Him with all their heart because they do not
know Him.</p>

<p>But as for those who live without knowing Him and without
seeking Him, they judge themselves so little worthy of their own
care, that they are not worthy of the care of others; and it needs
all the charity of the religion which they despise, not to despise
them even to the point of leaving them to their folly. But because
this religion obliges us always to regard them, so long as
they are in this life, as capable of the grace which can enlighten
them, and to believe that they may, in a little time, be more
replenished with faith than we are, and that, on the other hand,
we may fall into the blindness wherein they are, we must do
for them what we would they should do for us if we were in
their place, and call upon them to have pity upon themselves,
and to take at least some steps in the endeavour to find light.
Let them give to reading this some of the hours which they
otherwise employ so uselessly; whatever aversion they may
bring to the task, they will perhaps gain something, and at
least will not lose much. But as for those who bring to the task
perfect sincerity and a real desire to meet with truth, those I
hope will be satisfied and convinced of the proofs of a religion
so divine, which I have here collected, and in which I have
followed somewhat after this order ...</p>


<h4><a name="p_195" id="p_195"></a>195</h4>

<p>Before entering into the proofs of the Christian religion, I find
it necessary to point out the sinfulness of those men who live in
indifference to the search for truth in a matter which is so
important to them, and which touches them so nearly.</p>

<p>Of all their errors, this doubtless is the one which most
convicts them of foolishness and blindness, and in which it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
easiest to confound them by the first glimmerings of common
sense, and by natural feelings.</p>

<p>For it is not to be doubted that the duration of this life is but
a moment; that the state of death is eternal, whatever may be
its nature; and that thus all our actions and thoughts must
take such different directions according to the state of that
eternity, that it is impossible to take one step with sense and
judgment, unless we regulate our course by the truth of that
point which ought to be our ultimate end.</p>

<p>There is nothing clearer than this; and thus, according to the
principles of reason, the conduct of men is wholly unreasonable,
if they do not take another course.</p>

<p>On this point, therefore, we condemn those who live without
thought of the ultimate end of life, who let themselves be guided
by their own inclinations and their own pleasures without
reflection and without concern, and, as if they could annihilate
eternity by turning away their thought from it, think only of
making themselves happy for the moment.</p>

<p>Yet this eternity exists, and death, which must open into it,
and threatens them every hour, must in a little time infallibly
put them under the dreadful necessity of being either annihilated
or unhappy for ever, without knowing which of these eternities
is for ever prepared for them.</p>

<p>This is a doubt of terrible consequence. They are in peril of
eternal woe; and thereupon, as if the matter were not worth
the trouble, they neglect to inquire whether this is one of those
opinions which people receive with too credulous a facility, or
one of those which, obscure in themselves, have a very firm,
though hidden, foundation. Thus they know not whether
there be truth or falsity in the matter, nor whether there be
strength or weakness in the proofs. They have them before
their eyes; they refuse to look at them; and in that ignorance
they choose all that is necessary to fall into this misfortune if
it exists, to await death to make trial of it, yet to be very
content in this state, to make profession of it, and indeed to
boast of it. Can we think seriously on the importance of this
subject without being horrified at conduct so extravagant?</p>

<p>This resting in ignorance is a monstrous thing, and they who
pass their life in it must be made to feel its extravagance and
stupidity, by having it shown to them, so that they may be
confounded by the sight of their folly. For this is how men
reason, when they choose to live in such ignorance of what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
are, and without seeking enlightenment. "I know not," they
say ...</p>


<h4><a name="p_196" id="p_196"></a>196</h4>

<p>Men lack heart; they would not make a friend of it.</p>

<h4><a name="p_199" id="p_199"></a>199</h4>

<p>Let us imagine a number of men in chains, and all condemned
to death, where some are killed each day in the sight of the
others, and those who remain see their own fate in that of their
fellows, and wait their turn, looking at each other sorrowfully
and without hope. It is an image of the condition of men.</p>


<h4><a name="p_200" id="p_200"></a>200</h4>

<p>A man in a dungeon, ignorant whether his sentence be
pronounced, and having only one hour to learn it, but this
hour enough, if he know that it is pronounced, to obtain its
repeal, would act unnaturally in spending that hour, not in
ascertaining his sentence, but in playing piquet. So it is against
nature that man, etc. It is making heavy the hand of God.</p>

<p>Thus not only the zeal of those who seek Him proves God,
but also the blindness of those who seek Him not.</p>

in the eternity before and after, the little space which I fill, and

which I am ignorant, and which know me not, I am frightened,
and am astonished at being here rather than there; for there is
no reason why here rather than there, why now rather than
then. Who has put me here? By whose order and direction
have this place and time been allotted to me? <i>Memoria hospitis

<p>Why is my knowledge limited? Why my stature? Why my

number rather than another in the infinity of those from which
there is no more reason to choose one than another, trying
nothing else?</p>

sufficient for a question in philosophy; but not here, where it
concerns your all. And yet, after a trifling reflection of this
kind, we go to amuse ourselves, etc. Let us inquire of this
same religion whether it does not give a reason for this obscurity;
perhaps it will teach it to us.</p>

I would remain peacefully in faith. But, seeing too much to
deny and too little to be sure, I am in a state to be pitied;
wherefore I have a hundred time wished that if a God maintains
nature, she should testify to Him unequivocally, and
that, if the signs she gives are deceptive, she should suppress
them altogether; that she should say everything or nothing,
that I might see which cause I ought to follow. Whereas in
my present state, ignorant of what I am or of what I ought
to do, I know neither my condition nor my duty. My heart
inclines wholly to know where is the true good, in order to follow
it; nothing would be too dear to me for eternity.</p>

be joined to the body, and that we should have no soul; that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
world should be created, and that it should not be created, etc.;
that original sin should be, and that it should not be.</p>


<h4><a name="p_231" id="p_231"></a>231</h4>

<p>Do you believe it to be impossible that God is infinite, without
parts?—Yes. I wish therefore to show you an infinite and
indivisible thing. It is a point moving everywhere with an
infinite velocity; for it is one in all places, and is all totality in
every place.</p>

<p>Let this effect of nature, which previously seemed to you
impossible, make you know that there may be others of which
you are still ignorant. Do not draw this conclusion from your
experiment, that there remains nothing for you to know; but
rather that there remains an infinity for you to know.</p>


<h4><a name="p_232" id="p_232"></a>232</h4>

<p>Infinite movement, the point which fills everything, the
moment of rest; infinite without quantity, indivisible and infinite.</p>


<h4><a name="p_233" id="p_233"></a>233</h4>

<p><i>Infinite</i>—<i>nothing.</i>—Our soul is cast into a body, where it
finds number, time, dimension. Thereupon it reasons, and
calls this nature, necessity, and can believe nothing else.</p>

<p>Unity joined to infinity adds nothing to it, no more than one
foot to an infinite measure. The finite is annihilated in the
presence of the infinite, and becomes a pure nothing. So our
spirit before God, so our justice before divine justice. There is
not so great a disproportion between our justice and that of
God, as between unity and infinity.</p>

<p>The justice of God must be vast like His compassion. Now
justice to the outcast is less vast, and ought less to offend our
feelings than mercy towards the elect.</p>

<p>We know that there is an infinite, and are ignorant of its
nature. As we know it to be false that numbers are finite, it
is therefore true that there is an infinity in number. But we do
not know what it is. It is false that it is even, it is false that it
is odd; for the addition of a unit can make no change in its nature.
Yet it is a number, and every number is odd or even (this is
certainly true of every finite number). So we may well know
that there is a God without knowing what He is. Is there not
one substantial truth, seeing there are so many things which are
not the truth itself?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>We know then the existence and nature of the finite, because
we also are finite and have extension. We know the existence
of the infinite, and are ignorant of its nature, because it has
extension like us, but not limits like us. But we know neither
the existence nor the nature of God, because He has neither
extension nor limits.</p>

<p>But by faith we know His existence; in glory we shall know
His nature. Now, I have already shown that we may well
know the existence of a thing, without knowing its nature.</p>

<p>Let us now speak according to natural lights.</p>

<p>If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible, since,
having neither parts nor limits, He has no affinity to us. We
are then incapable of knowing either what He is or if He is.
This being so, who will dare to undertake the decision of the
question? Not we, who have no affinity to Him.</p>

<p>Who then will blame Christians for not being able to give a
reason for their belief, since they profess a religion for which
they cannot give a reason? They declare, in expounding it to
the world, that it is a foolishness, <i>stultitiam</i>;<a name="FNanchor_90_94" id="FNanchor_90_94"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_90_94" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and then you
complain that they do not prove it! If they proved it, they
would not keep their word; it is in lacking proofs, that they are
not lacking in sense. "Yes, but although this excuses those who
offer it as such, and takes away from them the blame of putting
it forward without reason, it does not excuse those who receive
it." Let us then examine this point, and say, "God is, or He
is not." But to which side shall we incline? Reason can decide
nothing here. There is an infinite chaos which separated us.
A game is being played at the extremity of this infinite distance
where heads or tails will turn up. What will you wager?
According to reason, you can do neither the one thing nor the
other; according to reason, you can defend neither of the
propositions.</p>

<p>Do not then reprove for error those who have made a choice;
for you know nothing about it. "No, but I blame them for
having made, not this choice, but a choice; for again both he
who chooses heads and he who chooses tails are equally at fault,
they are both in the wrong. The true course is not to wager
at all."</p>

<p>Yes; but you must wager. It is not optional. You are
embarked. Which will you choose then? Let us see. Since
you must choose, let us see which interests you least. You have
two things to lose, the true and the good; and two things to stake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness;
and your nature has two things to shun, error and misery.
Your reason is no more shocked in choosing one rather than the
other, since you must of necessity choose. This is one point
settled. But your happiness? Let us weigh the gain and the
loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances.
If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager,
then, without hesitation that He is.—"That is very fine. Yes,
I must wager; but I may perhaps wager too much."—Let us
see. Since there is an equal risk of gain and of loss, if you had
only to gain two lives, instead of one, you might still wager.
But if there were three lives to gain, you would have to play
(since you are under the necessity of playing), and you would
be imprudent, when you are forced to play, not to chance your
life to gain three at a game where there is an equal risk of loss
and gain. But there is an eternity of life and happiness. And
this being so, if there were an infinity of chances, of which one
only would be for you, you would still be right in wagering one
to win two, and you would act stupidly, being obliged to play,
by refusing to stake one life against three at a game in which out
of an infinity of chances there is one for you, if there were an
infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain. But there is here an
infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of gain
against a finite number of chances of loss, and what you stake is
finite. It is all divided; wherever the infinite is and there is not
an infinity of chances of loss against that of gain, there is no
time to hesitate, you must give all. And thus, when one is
forced to play, he must renounce reason to preserve his life,
rather than risk it for infinite gain, as likely to happen as the
loss of nothingness.</p>

<p>For it is no use to say it is uncertain if we will gain, and it is
certain that we risk, and that the infinite distance between the
<i>certainty</i> of what is staked and the <i>uncertainty</i> of what will be
gained, equals the finite good which is certainly staked against
the uncertain infinite. It is not so, as every player stakes a
certainty to gain an uncertainty, and yet he stakes a finite
certainty to gain a finite uncertainty, without transgressing
against reason. There is not an infinite distance between the
certainty staked and the uncertainty of the gain; that is untrue.
In truth, there is an infinity between the certainty of gain
and the certainty of loss. But the uncertainty of the gain is
proportioned to the certainty of the stake according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
proportion of the chances of gain and loss. Hence it comes that,
if there are as many risks on one side as on the other, the course
is to play even; and then the certainty of the stake is equal to
the uncertainty of the gain, so far is it from fact that there is an
infinite distance between them. And so our proposition is of
infinite force, when there is the finite to stake in a game where
there are equal risks of gain and of loss, and the infinite to gain.
This is demonstrable; and if men are capable of any truths, this
is one.</p>

<p>"I confess it, I admit it. But, still, is there no means of
seeing the faces of the cards?"—Yes, Scripture and the rest, etc.
"Yes, but I have my hands tied and my mouth closed; I am
forced to wager, and am not free. I am not released, and am
so made that I cannot believe. What, then, would you have
me do?"</p>

<p>True. But at least learn your inability to believe, since
reason brings you to this, and yet you cannot believe. Endeavour
then to convince yourself, not by increase of proofs of
God, but by the abatement of your passions. You would like
to attain faith, and do not know the way; you would like to
cure yourself of unbelief, and ask the remedy for it. Learn
of those who have been bound like you, and who now stake all
their possessions. These are people who know the way which
you would follow, and who are cured of an ill of which you would
be cured. Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if
they believed, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc.
Even this will naturally make you believe, and deaden your
acuteness.—"But this is what I am afraid of."—And why?
What have you to lose?</p>

<p>But to show you that this leads you there, it is this which will
lessen the passions, which are your stumbling-blocks.</p>

<p><i>The end of this discourse.</i>—Now, what harm will befall you in
taking this side? You will be faithful, honest, humble, grateful,
generous, a sincere friend, truthful. Certainly you will not
have those poisonous pleasures, glory and luxury; but will you
not have others? I will tell you that you will thereby gain in
this life, and that, at each step you take on this road, you will
see so great certainty of gain, so much nothingness in what you
risk, that you will at last recognise that you have wagered for
something certain and infinite, for which you have given nothing.</p>

<p>"Ah! This discourse transports me, charms me," etc.</p>

<p>If this discourse pleases you and seems impressive, know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
that it is made by a man who has knelt, both before and after
it, in prayer to that Being, infinite and without parts, before
whom he lays all he has, for you also to lay before Him all you
have for your own good and for His glory, that so strength may
be given to lowliness.</p>


<h4><a name="p_234" id="p_234"></a>234</h4>

<p>If we must not act save on a certainty, we ought not to act
on religion, for it is not certain. But how many things we do
on an uncertainty, sea voyages, battles! I say then we must do
nothing at all, for nothing is certain, and that there is more
certainty in religion than there is as to whether we may see
to-morrow; for it is not certain that we may see to-morrow, and
it is certainly possible that we may not see it. We cannot say
as much about religion. It is not certain that it is; but who
will venture to say that it is certainly possible that it is not?
Now when we work for to-morrow, and so on an uncertainty,
we act reasonably; for we ought to work for an uncertainty
according to the doctrine of chance which was demonstrated
above.</p>

<p>Saint Augustine has seen that we work for an uncertainty, on
sea, in battle, etc. But he has not seen the doctrine of chance
which proves that we should do so. Montaigne has seen that
we are shocked at a fool, and that habit is all-powerful; but he
has not seen the reason of this effect.</p>

<p>All these persons have seen the effects, but they have not
seen the causes. They are, in comparison with those who have
discovered the causes, as those who have only eyes are in comparison
with those who have intellect. For the effects are
perceptible by sense, and the causes are visible only to the
intellect. And although these effects are seen by the mind,
this mind is, in comparison with the mind which sees the causes,
as the bodily senses are in comparison with the intellect.</p>


<h4><a name="p_235" id="p_235"></a>235</h4>

<p><i>Rem viderunt, causam non viderunt.</i></p>


<h4><a name="p_236" id="p_236"></a>236</h4>

<p>According to the doctrine of chance, you ought to put yourself
to the trouble of searching for the truth; for if you die without
worshipping the True Cause, you are lost.—"But," say you,
"if He had wished me to worship Him, He would have left me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
signs of His will."—He has done so; but you neglect them.
Seek them, therefore; it is well worth it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_237" id="p_237"></a>237</h4>

<p><i>Chances.</i>—We must live differently in the world, according to
these different assumptions: (1) that we could always remain
in it; (2) that it is certain that we shall not remain here long,
and uncertain if we shall remain here one hour. This last
assumption is our condition.</p>


<h4><a name="p_238" id="p_238"></a>238</h4>

<p>What do you then promise me, in addition to certain troubles,

hard to please without success?</p>


<h4><a name="p_239" id="p_239"></a>239</h4>

<p><i>Objection.</i>—Those who hope for salvation are so far happy;
but they have as a counterpoise the fear of hell.</p>

<p><i>Reply.</i>—Who has most reason to fear hell: he who is in
ignorance whether there is a hell, and who is certain of damnation
if there is; or he who certainly believes there is a hell, and hopes
to be saved if there is?</p>

<p>"I would soon have renounced pleasure," say they, "had I
faith." For my part I tell you, "You would soon have faith, if
you renounced pleasure." Now, it is for you to begin. If I
could, I would give you faith. I cannot do so, nor therefore
test the truth of what you say. But you can well renounce
pleasure, and test whether what I say is true.</p>

<h2><a name="SECTION_IV" id="SECTION_IV"></a>SECTION IV</h2>

<h3>OF THE MEANS OF BELIEF</h3>


<h4><a name="p_242" id="p_242"></a>242</h4>

<p><i>Preface to the second part.</i>—To speak of those who have
treated of this matter.</p>

<p>I admire the boldness with which these persons undertake to
speak of God. In addressing their argument to infidels, their
first chapter is to prove Divinity from the works of nature.<a name="FNanchor_91_95" id="FNanchor_91_95"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_91_95" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> I
should not be astonished at their enterprise, if they were
addressing their argument to the faithful; for it is certain that
those who have the living faith in their heart see at once that
all existence is none other than the work of the God whom they
adore. But for those in whom this light is extinguished, and in
whom we purpose to rekindle it, persons destitute of faith and
grace, who, seeking with all their light whatever they see in
nature that can bring them to this knowledge, find only obscurity
and darkness; to tell them that they have only to look at the
smallest things which surround them, and they will see God
openly, to give them, as a complete proof of this great and
important matter, the course of the moon and planets, and to
claim to have concluded the proof with such an argument, is to
give them ground for believing that the proofs of our religion
are very weak. And I see by reason and experience that nothing
is more calculated to arouse their contempt.</p>

<p>It is not after this manner that Scripture speaks, which has
a better knowledge of the things that are of God. It says, on
the contrary, that God is a hidden God, and that, since the
corruption of nature, He has left men in a darkness from which
they can escape only through Jesus Christ, without whom all
communion with God is cut off. <i>Nemo novit Patrem, nisi
Filius, et cui voluerit Filius revelare.</i><a name="FNanchor_92_96" id="FNanchor_92_96"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_92_96" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>This is what Scripture points out to us, when it says in so
many places that those who seek God find Him.<a name="FNanchor_93_97" id="FNanchor_93_97"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_93_97" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> It is not of
that light, "like the noonday sun," that this is said. We do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
not say that those who seek the noonday sun, or water in the
sea, shall find them; and hence the evidence of God must not
be of this nature. So it tells us elsewhere: <i>Vere tu es Deus
absconditus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_94_98" id="FNanchor_94_98"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_94_98" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>


<h4><a name="p_243" id="p_243"></a>243</h4>

<p>It is an astounding fact that no canonical writer has ever
made use of nature to prove God. They all strive to make us
believe in Him. David, Solomon, etc., have never said, "There
is no void, therefore there is a God." They must have had
more knowledge than the most learned people who came after
them, and who have all made use of this argument. This is
worthy of attention.</p>


<h4><a name="p_244" id="p_244"></a>244</h4>

<p>"Why! Do you not say yourself that the heavens and birds
prove God?" No. "And does your religion not say so?" No.
For although it is true in a sense for some souls to whom God
gives this light, yet it is false with respect to the majority of men.</p>


<h4><a name="p_245" id="p_245"></a>245</h4>

<p>There are three sources of belief: reason, custom, inspiration.
The Christian religion, which alone has reason, does not acknowledge
as her true children those who believe without inspiration.
It is not that she excludes reason and custom. On the contrary,
the mind must be opened to proofs, must be confirmed by custom,
and offer itself in humbleness to inspirations, which alone can
produce a true and saving effect. <i>Ne evacuetur crux Christi.</i><a name="FNanchor_95_99" id="FNanchor_95_99"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_95_99" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>


<h4><a name="p_246" id="p_246"></a>246</h4>

<p><i>Order.</i>—After the letter <i>That we ought to seek God</i>, to write
the letter <i>On removing obstacles</i>; which is the discourse on
"the machine,"<a name="FNanchor_96_100" id="FNanchor_96_100"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_96_100" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> on preparing the machine, on seeking by reason.</p>


<h4><a name="p_247" id="p_247"></a>247</h4>

<p><i>Order.</i>—A letter of exhortation to a friend to induce him to
seek. And he will reply, "But what is the use of seeking?
Nothing is seen." Then to reply to him, "Do not despair."
And he will answer that he would be glad to find some light, but
that, according to this very religion, if he believed in it, it will
be of no use to him, and that therefore he prefers not to seek.
And to answer to that: The machine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_248" id="p_248"></a>248</h4>

<p><i>A letter which indicates the use of proofs by the machine.</i>—
Faith is different from proof; the one is human, the other is a
gift of God. <i>Justus ex fide vivit.</i><a name="FNanchor_97_101" id="FNanchor_97_101"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_97_101" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> It is this faith that God
Himself puts into the heart, of which the proof is often the instrument,
<i>fides ex auditu</i>;<a name="FNanchor_98_102" id="FNanchor_98_102"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_98_102" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> but this faith is in the heart, and makes
us not say <i>scio</i>, but <i>credo</i>.</p>


<h4><a name="p_249" id="p_249"></a>249</h4>

<p>It is superstition to put one's hope in formalities; but it is
pride to be unwilling to submit to them.</p>


<h4><a name="p_250" id="p_250"></a>250</h4>

<p>The external must be joined to the internal to obtain anything
from God, that is to say, we must kneel, pray with the lips, etc.,
in order that proud man, who would not submit himself to God,
may be now subject to the creature.<a name="FNanchor_99_103" id="FNanchor_99_103"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_99_103" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> To expect help from these
externals is superstition; to refuse to join them to the internal
is pride.</p>


<h4><a name="p_251" id="p_251"></a>251</h4>

<p>Other religions, as the pagan, are more popular, for they
consist in externals. But they are not for educated people. A
purely intellectual religion would be more suited to the learned,
but it would be of no use to the common people. The Christian
religion alone is adapted to all, being composed of externals and
internals. It raises the common people to the internal, and
humbles the proud to the external; it is not perfect without the
two, for the people must understand the spirit of the letter, and
the learned must submit their spirit to the letter.</p>


<h4><a name="p_252" id="p_252"></a>252</h4>

<p>For we must not misunderstand ourselves; we are as much
automatic as intellectual; and hence it comes that the instrument
by which conviction is attained is not demonstrated alone.
How few things are demonstrated? Proofs only convince the
mind. Custom is the source of our strongest and most believed
proofs. It bends the automaton, which persuades the mind
without its thinking about the matter. Who has demonstrated
that there will be a to-morrow, and that we shall die? And what is
more believed? It is, then, custom which persuades us of it; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
custom that makes so many men Christians; custom that makes
them Turks, heathens, artisans, soldiers, etc. (Faith in baptism
is more received among Christians than among Turks.) Finally,
we must have recourse to it when once the mind has seen where
the truth is, in order to quench our thirst, and steep ourselves in
that belief, which escapes us at every hour; for always to have
proofs ready is too much trouble. We must get an easier belief,
which is that of custom, which, without violence, without art,
without argument, makes us believe things, and inclines all our
powers to this belief, so that out soul falls naturally into it. It
is not enough to believe only by force of conviction, when the
automaton is inclined to believe the contrary. Both our parts
must be made to believe, the mind by reasons which it is sufficient
to have seen once in a lifetime, and the automaton by custom,
and by not allowing it to incline to the contrary. <i>Inclina cor
meum, Deus.</i><a name="FNanchor_100_104" id="FNanchor_100_104"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_100_104" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The reason acts slowly, with so many examinations, and on so
many principles, which must be always present, that at every
hour it falls asleep, or wanders, through want of having all its
principles present. Feeling does not act thus; it acts in a
moment, and is always ready to act. We must then put our
faith in feeling; otherwise it will be always vacillating.</p>


<h4><a name="p_253" id="p_253"></a>253</h4>

<p>Two extremes: to exclude reason, to admit reason only.</p>


<h4><a name="p_254" id="p_254"></a>254</h4>

<p>It is not a rare thing to have to reprove the world for too much
docility. It is a natural vice like credulity, and as pernicious.
Superstition.</p>


<h4><a name="p_255" id="p_255"></a>255</h4>

<p>Piety is different from superstition.</p>

<p>To carry piety as far as superstition is to destroy it.</p>

<p>The heretics reproach us for this superstitious submission.
This is to do what they reproach us for ...</p>

<p>Infidelity, not to believe in the Eucharist, because it is not seen.</p>

<p>Superstition to believe propositions. Faith, etc.</p>


<h4><a name="p_256" id="p_256"></a>256</h4>

<p>I say there are few true Christians, even as regards faith.
There are many who believe but from superstition. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
many who do not believe solely from wickedness. Few are
between the two.</p>

<p>In this I do not include those who are of truly pious character,
nor all those who believe from a feeling in their heart.</p>


<h4><a name="p_257" id="p_257"></a>257</h4>

<p>There are only three kinds of persons; those who serve God,
having found Him; others who are occupied in seeking Him, not
having found Him; while the remainder live without seeking
Him, and without having found Him. The first are reasonable
and happy, the last are foolish and unhappy; those between are
unhappy and reasonable.</p>


<h4><a name="p_258" id="p_258"></a>258</h4>

<p><i>Unusquisque sibi Deum fingit.</i><a name="FNanchor_101_105" id="FNanchor_101_105"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_101_105" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Disgust.</p>


<h4><a name="p_259" id="p_259"></a>259</h4>

<p>Ordinary people have the power of not thinking of that about
which they do not wish to think. "Do not meditate on the
passages about the Messiah," said the Jew to his son. Thus our
people often act. Thus are false religions preserved, and even
the true one, in regard to many persons.</p>

<p>But there are some who have not the power of thus
preventing thought, and who think so much the more as they
are forbidden. These undo false religions, and even the true
one, if they do not find solid arguments.</p>


<h4><a name="p_260" id="p_260"></a>260</h4>

<p>They hide themselves in the press, and call numbers to their
rescue. Tumult.</p>

<p><i>Authority.</i>—So far from making it a rule to believe a thing
because you have heard it, you ought to believe nothing without
putting yourself into the position as if you had never heard it.</p>

<p>It is your own assent to yourself, and the constant voice of
your own reason, and not of others, that should make you believe.</p>

<p>Belief is so important! A hundred contradictions might be
true. If antiquity were the rule of belief, men of ancient time
would then be without rule. If general consent, if men had
perished?</p>

<p>False humanity, pride.</p>

<p>Lift the curtain. You try in vain; if you must either believe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
or deny, or doubt. Shall we then have no rule? We judge that
animals do well what they do. Is there no rule whereby to
judge men?</p>

<p>To deny, to believe, and to doubt well, are to a man what the
race is to a horse.</p>

<p>Punishment of those who sin, error.</p>


<h4><a name="p_261" id="p_261"></a>261</h4>

<p>Those who do not love the truth take as a pretext that it is
disputed, and that a multitude deny it. And so their error
arises only from this, that they do not love either truth or charity.
Thus they are without excuse.</p>


<h4><a name="p_262" id="p_262"></a>262</h4>

<p>Superstition and lust. Scruples, evil desires. Evil fear; fear,
not such as comes from a belief in God, but such as comes from
a doubt whether He exists or not. True fear comes from faith;
false fear comes from doubt. True fear is joined to hope,
because it is born of faith, and because men hope in the God in
whom they believe. False fear is joined to despair, because
men fear the God in whom they have no belief. The former
fear to lose Him; the latter fear to find Him.</p>

<p>"A miracle," says one, "would strengthen my faith." He
says so when he does not see one. Reasons, seen from afar,
appear to limit our view; but when they are reached, we begin
to see beyond. Nothing stops the nimbleness of our mind.
There is no rule, say we, which has not some exceptions, no
truth so general which has not some aspect in which it fails.
It is sufficient that it be not absolutely universal to give us a
pretext for applying the exceptions to the present subject, and
for saying, "This is not always true; there are therefore cases
where it is not so." It only remains to show that this is one
of them; and that is why we are very awkward or unlucky, if
we do not find one some day.</p>

<p>We do not weary of eating and sleeping every day, for hunger
and sleepiness recur. Without that we should weary of them.
So, without the hunger for spiritual things, we weary of them.
Hunger after righteousness, the eighth beatitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_102_106" id="FNanchor_102_106"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_102_106" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Faith indeed tells what the senses do not tell, but not the
contrary of what they see. It is above them and not contrary
to them.</p>


<h4><a name="p_266" id="p_266"></a>266</h4>

<p>How many stars have telescopes revealed to us which did not
exist for our philosophers of old! We freely attack Holy Scripture
on the great number of stars, saying, "There are only one
thousand and twenty-eight,<a name="FNanchor_103_107" id="FNanchor_103_107"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_103_107" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> we know it." There is grass on the
earth, we see it—from the moon we would not see it—and on
the grass are leaves, and in these leaves are small animals; but
after that no more.—O presumptuous man!—The compounds
are composed of elements, and the elements not.—O presumptuous
man! Here is a fine reflection.—We must not say that
there is anything which we do not see.—We must then talk like
others, but not think like them.</p>


<h4><a name="p_267" id="p_267"></a>267</h4>

<p>The last proceeding of reason is to recognise that there is an
infinity of things which are beyond it. It is but feeble if it
does not see so far as to know this. But if natural things are
beyond it, what will be said of supernatural?</p>


<h4><a name="p_268" id="p_268"></a>268</h4>

<p><i>Submission.</i>—We must know where to doubt, where to feel
certain, where to submit. He who does not do so, understands
not the force of reason. There are some who offend against
these three rules, either by affirming everything as demonstrative,
from want of knowing what demonstration is; or by doubting
everything, from want of knowing where to submit; or by submitting
in everything, from want of knowing where they must
judge.</p>


<h4><a name="p_269" id="p_269"></a>269</h4>

<p>Submission is the use of reason in which consists true
Christianity.</p>

that there are some occasions on which it ought to submit. It
is then right for it to submit, when it judges that it ought to
submit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>There is nothing so conformable to reason as this disavowal
of reason.</p>


<h4><a name="p_273" id="p_273"></a>273</h4>

<p>If we submit everything to reason, our religion will have no
mysterious and supernatural element. If we offend the
principles of reason, our religion will be absurd and ridiculous.</p>


<h4><a name="p_274" id="p_274"></a>274</h4>

<p>All our reasoning reduces itself to yielding to feeling.</p>

<p>But fancy is like, though contrary to feeling, so that we
cannot distinguish between these contraries. One person says
that my feeling is fancy, another that his fancy is feeling. We
should have a rule. Reason offers itself; but it is pliable in
every sense; and thus there is no rule.</p>


<h4><a name="p_275" id="p_275"></a>275</h4>

<p>Men often take their imagination for their heart; and they
believe they are converted as soon as they think of being
converted.</p>


<h4><a name="p_276" id="p_276"></a>276</h4>

<p>M. de Roannez said: "Reasons come to me afterwards, but
at first a thing pleases or shocks me without my knowing the
reason, and yet it shocks me for that reason which I only discover
afterwards." But I believe, not that it shocked him
for the reasons which were found afterwards, but that these
reasons were only found because it shocks him.</p>


<h4><a name="p_277" id="p_277"></a>277</h4>

<p>The heart has its reasons, which reason does not know. We
feel it in a thousand things. I say that the heart naturally loves
the Universal Being, and also itself naturally, according as it
gives itself to them; and it hardens itself against one or the other
at its will. You have rejected the one, and kept the other. Is
it by reason that you love yourself?</p>


<h4><a name="p_278" id="p_278"></a>278</h4>

<p>It is the heart which experiences God, and not the reason.
This, then, is faith: God felt by the heart, not by the reason.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_279" id="p_279"></a>279</h4>

<p>Faith is a gift of God; do not believe that we said it was a
gift of reasoning. Other religions do not say this of their faith.
They only gave reasoning in order to arrive at it, and yet it
does not bring them to it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_280" id="p_280"></a>280</h4>

<p>The knowledge of God is very far from the love of Him.</p>


<h4><a name="p_281" id="p_281"></a>281</h4>

<p>Heart, instinct, principles.</p>


<h4><a name="p_282" id="p_282"></a>282</h4>

<p>We know truth, not only by the reason, but also by the heart,
and it is in this last way that we know first principles; and
reason, which has no part in it, tries in vain to impugn them. The
sceptics, who have only this for their object, labour to no purpose.
We know that we do not dream, and however impossible it is for
us to prove it by reason, this inability demonstrates only the
weakness of our reason, but not, as they affirm, the uncertainty
of all our knowledge. For the knowledge of first principles, as
space, time, motion, number, is as sure as any of those which
we get from reasoning. And reason must trust these intuitions
of the heart, and must base them on every argument. (We
have intuitive knowledge of the tri-dimensional nature of space,
and of the infinity of number, and reason then shows that there
are no two square numbers one of which is double of the other.
Principles are intuited, propositions are inferred, all with
certainty, though in different ways.) And it is as useless and
absurd for reason to demand from the heart proofs of her first
principles, before admitting them, as it would be for the heart
to demand from reason an intuition of all demonstrated propositions
before accepting them.</p>

<p>This inability ought, then, to serve only to humble reason,
which would judge all, but not to impugn our certainty, as if
only reason were capable of instructing us. Would to God, on
the contrary, that we had never need of it, and that we knew
everything by instinct and intuition! But nature has refused us
this boon. On the contrary, she has given us but very little
knowledge of this kind; and all the rest can be acquired only by
reasoning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, those to whom God has imparted religion by
intuition are very fortunate, and justly convinced. But to
those who do not have it, we can give it only by reasoning,
waiting for God to give them spiritual insight, without which
faith is only human, and useless for salvation.</p>


<h4><a name="p_283" id="p_283"></a>283</h4>

<p><i>Order.—Against the objection that Scripture has no order.</i></p>

<p>The heart has its own order; the intellect has its own, which
is by principle and demonstration. The heart has another. We
do not prove that we ought to be loved by enumerating in order
the causes of love; that would be ridiculous.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ and Saint Paul employ the rule of love, not of
intellect; for they would warm, not instruct. It is the same
with Saint Augustine. This order consists chiefly in digressions
on each point to indicate the end, and keep it always in sight.</p>


<h4><a name="p_284" id="p_284"></a>284</h4>

<p>Do not wonder to see simple people believe without reasoning.
God imparts to them love of Him and hatred of self. He inclines
their heart to believe. Men will never believe with a saving
and real faith, unless God inclines their heart; and they will
believe as soon as He inclines it. And this is what David
knew well, when he said: <i>Inclina cor meum, Deus, in ...</i><a name="FNanchor_106_110" id="FNanchor_106_110"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_106_110" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>


<h4><a name="p_285" id="p_285"></a>285</h4>

<p>Religion is suited to all kinds of minds. Some pay attention
only to its establishment,<a name="FNanchor_107_111" id="FNanchor_107_111"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_107_111" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and this religion is such that its
very establishment suffices to prove its truth. Others trace
it even to the apostles. The more learned go back to the
beginning of the world. The angels see it better still, and from
a more distant time.</p>


<h4><a name="p_286" id="p_286"></a>286</h4>

<p>Those who believe without having read the Testaments, do so
because they have an inward disposition entirely holy, and all
that they hear of our religion conforms to it. They feel that a
God has made them; they desire only to love God; they desire to
hate themselves only. They feel that they have no strength in
themselves; that they are incapable of coming to God; and that
if God does not come to them, they can have no communion
with Him. And they hear our religion say that men must love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
God only, and hate self only; but that all being corrupt and
unworthy of God, God made Himself man to unite Himself to
us. No more is required to persuade men who have this disposition
in their heart, and who have this knowledge of their
duty and of their inefficiency.</p>


<h4><a name="p_287" id="p_287"></a>287</h4>

<p>Those whom we see to be Christians without the knowledge
of the prophets and evidences, nevertheless judge of their
religion as well as those who have that knowledge. They judge
of it by the heart, as others judge of it by the intellect. God
Himself inclines them to believe, and thus they are most
effectively convinced.</p>

<p>I confess indeed that one of those Christians who believe
without proofs will not perhaps be capable of convincing an
infidel who will say the same of himself. But those who know
the proofs of religion will prove without difficulty that such a
believer is truly inspired by God, though he cannot prove it
himself.</p>

<p>For God having said in His prophecies (which are undoubtedly
prophecies), that in the reign of Jesus Christ He would spread
His spirit abroad among nations, and that the youths and
maidens and children of the Church would prophesy;<a name="FNanchor_108_112" id="FNanchor_108_112"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_108_112" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> it is
certain that the Spirit of God is in these, and not in the others.</p>


<h4><a name="p_288" id="p_288"></a>288</h4>

<p>Instead of complaining that God had hidden Himself, you will
give Him thanks for having revealed so much of Himself; and
you will also give Him thanks for not having revealed Himself
to haughty sages, unworthy to know so holy a God.</p>

<p>Two kinds of persons know Him: those who have a humble
heart, and who love lowliness, whatever kind of intellect they
may have, high or low; and those who have sufficient understanding
to see the truth, whatever opposition they may have
to it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_289" id="p_289"></a>289</h4>

<p><i>Proof.</i>—1. The Christian religion, by its establishment, having
established itself so strongly, so gently, whilst contrary to
nature.—2. The sanctity, the dignity, and the humility of a
Christian soul.—3. The miracles of Holy Scripture.—4. Jesus
Christ in particular.—5. The apostles in particular.—6. Moses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and the prophets in particular.—7. The Jewish people.—8.
The prophecies.—9. Perpetuity; no religion has perpetuity.—
10. The doctrine which gives a reason for everything.—11.
The sanctity of this law.—12. By the course of the world.</p>

<p>Surely, after considering what is life and what is religion, we
should not refuse to obey the inclination to follow it, if it comes
into our heart; and it is certain that there is no ground for
laughing at those who follow it.</p>

<h3>JUSTICE AND THE REASON OF EFFECTS</h3>


<h4><a name="p_291" id="p_291"></a>291</h4>

<p>In the letter <i>On Injustice</i> can come the ridiculousness of the
law that the elder gets all. "My friend, you were born on this
side of the mountain, it is therefore just that your elder brother
gets everything."</p>

<p>"Why do you kill me?"</p>


<h4><a name="p_292" id="p_292"></a>292</h4>

<p>He lives on the other side of the water.</p>


<h4><a name="p_293" id="p_293"></a>293</h4>

<p>"Why do you kill me? What! do you not live on the other
side of the water? If you lived on this side, my friend, I should
be an assassin, and it would be unjust to slay you in this manner.
But since you live on the other side, I am a hero, and it is just."</p>


<h4><a name="p_294" id="p_294"></a>294</h4>

<p>On what shall man found the order of the world which he
would govern?<a name="FNanchor_109_113" id="FNanchor_109_113"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_109_113" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Shall it be on the caprice of each individual?
What confusion! Shall it be on justice? Man is ignorant of it.</p>

<p>Certainly had he known it, he would not have established this
maxim, the most general of all that obtain among men, that
each should follow the custom of his own country. The glory
of true equity would have brought all nations under subjection,
and legislators would not have taken as their model the fancies
and caprice of Persians and Germans instead of this unchanging
justice. We should have seen it set up in all the States on earth
and in all times; whereas we see neither justice nor injustice
which does not change its nature with change in climate. Three
degrees of latitude reverse all jurisprudence; a meridian decides
the truth. Fundamental laws change after a few years of
possession; right has its epochs; the entry of Saturn into the Lion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
marks to us the origin of such and such a crime. A strange
justice that is bounded by a river! Truth on this side of the
Pyrenees, error on the other side.</p>

<p>Men admit that justice does not consist in these customs, but
that it resides in natural laws, common to every country. They
would certainly maintain it obstinately, if reckless chance which
has distributed human laws had encountered even one which
was universal; but the farce is that the caprice of men has so
many vagaries that there is no such law.</p>

<p>Theft, incest, infanticide, parricide, have all had a place among
virtuous actions. Can anything be more ridiculous than that
a man should have the right to kill me because he lives on the
other side of the water, and because his ruler has a quarrel with
mine, though I have none with him?</p>

<p>Doubtless there are natural laws; but good reason once
corrupted has corrupted all. <i>Nihil amplius nostrum est;<a name="FNanchor_110_114" id="FNanchor_110_114"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_110_114" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> quod
nostrum dicimus, artis est. Ex senatus—consultis et plebiscitis
crimina exercentur.<a name="FNanchor_111_115" id="FNanchor_111_115"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_111_115" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Ut olim vitiis, sic nunc legibus laboramus.</i><a name="FNanchor_112_116" id="FNanchor_112_116"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_112_116" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The result of this confusion is that one affirms the essence of
justice to be the authority of the legislator; another, the interest
of the sovereign;<a name="FNanchor_113_117" id="FNanchor_113_117"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_113_117" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> another, present custom,<a name="FNanchor_114_118" id="FNanchor_114_118"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_114_118" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and this is the most
sure. Nothing, according to reason alone, is just in itself; all
changes with time. Custom creates the whole of equity, for
the simple reason that it is accepted. It is the mystical foundation
of its authority;<a name="FNanchor_115_119" id="FNanchor_115_119"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_115_119" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> whoever carries it back to first principles
destroys it. Nothing is so faulty as those laws which correct
faults. He who obeys them because they are just, obeys a
justice which is imaginary, and not the essence of law; it is quite
self-contained, it is law and nothing more. He who will examine
its motive will find it so feeble and so trifling that if he be not
accustomed to contemplate the wonders of human imagination,
he will marvel that one century has gained for it so much pomp
and reverence. The art of opposition and of revolution is to
unsettle established customs, sounding them even to their
source, to point out their want of authority and justice. We
must, it is said, get back to the natural and fundamental laws of
the State, which an unjust custom has abolished. It is a game
certain to result in the loss of all; nothing will be just on the
balance. Yet people readily lend their ear to such arguments.
They shake off the yoke as soon as they recognise it; and the
great profit by their ruin, and by that of these curious investigators
of accepted customs. But from a contrary mistake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
men sometimes think they can justly do everything which is
not without an example. That is why the wisest of legislators<a name="FNanchor_116_120" id="FNanchor_116_120"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_116_120" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
said that it was necessary to deceive men for their own good;
and another, a good politician, <i>Cum veritatem qua liberetur
ignoret, expedit quod fallatur.</i><a name="FNanchor_117_121" id="FNanchor_117_121"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_117_121" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> We must not see the fact of
usurpation; law was once introduced without reason, and has
become reasonable. We must make it regarded as authoritative,
eternal, and conceal its origin, if we do not wish that it should
soon come to an end.</p>


<h4><a name="p_295" id="p_295"></a>295</h4>

<p><i>Mine, thine.</i>—"This dog is mine," said those poor children;

<p>When the question for consideration is whether we ought to
make war, and kill so many men—condemn so many Spaniards

<p><i>Veri juris.</i><a name="FNanchor_118_122" id="FNanchor_118_122"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_118_122" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>—We have it no more; if we had it, we should take
conformity to the customs of a country as the rule of justice.
It is here that, not finding justice, we have found force, etc.</p>


<h4><a name="p_298" id="p_298"></a>298</h4>

<p><i>Justice, might.</i>—It is right that what is just should be obeyed;
it is necessary that what is strongest should be obeyed. Justice
without might is helpless; might without justice is tyrannical.
Justice without might is gainsaid, because there are always
offenders; might without justice is condemned. We must then
combine justice and might, and for this end make what is just
strong, or what is strong just.</p>

<p>Justice is subject to dispute; might is easily recognised and
is not disputed. So we cannot give might to justice, because
might has gainsaid justice, and has declared that it is she herself
who is just. And thus being unable to make what is just strong,
we have made what is strong just.</p>


<h4><a name="p_299" id="p_299"></a>299</h4>

<p>The only universal rules are the laws of the country in ordinary
affairs, and of the majority in others. Whence comes this?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
From the might which is in them. Hence it comes that kings,
who have power of a different kind, do not follow the majority
of their ministers.</p>

<p>No doubt equality of goods is just; but, being unable to cause
might to obey justice, men have made it just to obey might.
Unable to strengthen justice, they have justified might; so that
the just and the strong should unite, and there should be peace,
which is the sovereign good.</p>


<h4><a name="p_300" id="p_300"></a>300</h4>

<h4><a name="p_301" id="p_301"></a>301</h4>

<p>Why do we follow the majority? It is because they have more
reason? No, because they have more power.</p>

<p>Why do we follow the ancient laws and opinions? Is it
because they are more sound? No, but because they are unique,
and remove from us the root of difference.</p>


<h4><a name="p_302" id="p_302"></a>302</h4>

<p>... It is the effect of might, not of custom. For those who
are capable of originality are few; the greater number will only
follow, and refuse glory to those inventors who seek it by their
inventions. And if these are obstinate in their wish to obtain
glory, and despise those who do not invent, the latter will call
them ridiculous names, and would beat them with a stick. Let
no one then boast of his subtlety, or let him keep his complacency
to himself.</p>


<h4><a name="p_303" id="p_303"></a>303</h4>

<p>Might is the sovereign of the world, and not opinion.—But
opinion makes use of might.—It is might that makes opinion.
Gentleness is beautiful in our opinion. Why? Because he who
will dance on a rope will be alone,<a name="FNanchor_120_124" id="FNanchor_120_124"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_120_124" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and I will gather a stronger
mob of people who will say that it is unbecoming.</p>


<h4><a name="p_304" id="p_304"></a>304</h4>

<p>The cords which bind the respect of men to each other are in
general cords of necessity; for there must be different degrees, all
men wishing to rule, and not all being able to do so, but some
being able.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us then imagine we see society in the process of formation.
Men will doubtless fight till the stronger party overcomes the
weaker, and a dominant party is established. But when this is
once determined, the masters, who do not desire the continuation
of strife, then decree that the power which is in their hands shall
be transmitted as they please. Some place it in election by the
people, others in hereditary succession, etc.</p>

<p>And this is the point where imagination begins to play its
part. Till now power makes fact; now power is sustained by
imagination in a certain party, in France in the nobility, in
Switzerland in the burgesses, etc.</p>

<p>These cords which bind the respect of men to such and such
an individual are therefore the cords of imagination.</p>


<h4><a name="p_305" id="p_305"></a>305</h4>

<p>The Swiss are offended by being called gentlemen, and prove
themselves true plebeians in order to be thought worthy of

<p>As duchies, kingships, and magistracies are real and necessary,

<p>The habit of seeing kings accompanied by guards, drums,
officers, and all the paraphernalia which mechanically inspire
respect and awe, makes their countenance, when sometimes seen
alone without these accompaniments, impress respect and awe
on their subjects; because we cannot separate in thought their
persons from the surroundings with which we see them usually
joined. And the world, which knows not that this effect is the
result of habit, believes that it arises by a natural force, whence
come these words, "The character of Divinity is stamped on his
countenance," etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>The property of riches is to be given liberally.</p>

<p><i>The reason of effects.</i>—It is wonderful that men would not have

<p><i>Sound opinions of the people.</i>—To be spruce is not altogether
foolish, for it proves that a great number of people work for one.
It shows by one's hair, that one has a valet, a perfumer, etc.,

superficial nor merely outward show to have many arms at

To be spruce is to show one's power.</p>


<h4><a name="p_317" id="p_317"></a>317</h4>

<p>Deference means, "Put yourself to inconvenience." This is
apparently silly, but is quite right. For it is to say, "I would
indeed put myself to inconvenience if you required it, since
indeed I do so when it is of no service to you." Deference
further serves to distinguish the great. Now if deference was
displayed by sitting in an arm-chair, we should show deference
to everybody, and so no distinction would be made; but, being
put to inconvenience, we distinguish very well.</p>

But I am as clever as he. We should have to fight over this.

<p>The most unreasonable things in the world become most
reasonable, because of the unruliness of men. What is less
reasonable than to choose the eldest son of a queen to rule a
State? We do not choose as captain of a ship the passenger who
is of the best family.</p>

<p>This law would be absurd and unjust; but because men are so
themselves, and always will be so, it becomes reasonable and
just. For whom will men choose, as the most virtuous and able?
We at once come to blows, as each claims to be the most virtuous
and able. Let us then attach this quality to something indisputable.
This is the king's eldest son. That is clear, and there
is no dispute. Reason can do no better, for civil war is the
greatest of evils.</p>


<h4><a name="p_321" id="p_321"></a>321</h4>

<p>Children are astonished to see their comrades respected.</p>


<h4><a name="p_322" id="p_322"></a>322</h4>

<p>To be of noble birth is a great advantage. In eighteen years
it places a man within the select circle, known and respected,
as another would have merited in fifty years. It is a gain of
thirty years without trouble.</p>


<h4><a name="p_323" id="p_323"></a>323</h4>

<p>What is the Ego?</p>

<p>Suppose a man puts himself at a window to see those who
pass by. If I pass by, can I say that he placed himself there to
see me? No; for he does not think of me in particular. But
does he who loves someone on account of beauty really love
that person? No; for the small-pox, which will kill beauty without
killing the person, will cause him to love her no more.</p>

<p>And if one loves me for my judgment, memory, he does not
love <i>me</i>, for I can lose these qualities without losing myself.
Where, then, is this Ego, if it be neither in the body nor in the
soul? And how love the body or the soul, except for these
qualities which do not constitute <i>me</i>, since they are perishable?
For it is impossible and would be unjust to love the soul of a
person in the abstract, and whatever qualities might be therein.
We never, then, love a person, but only qualities.</p>

<p>Let us, then, jeer no more at those who are honoured on
account of rank and office; for we love a person only on
account of borrowed qualities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_324" id="p_324"></a>324</h4>

<p>The people have very sound opinions, for example:</p>

<p>1. In having preferred diversion and hunting to poetry. The
half-learned laugh at it, and glory in being above the folly of the
world; but the people are right for a reason which these do not
fathom.</p>

<p>2. In having distinguished men by external marks, as birth or
wealth. The world again exults in showing how unreasonable
this is; but it is very reasonable. Savages laugh at an infant
king.<a name="FNanchor_123_127" id="FNanchor_123_127"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_123_127" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>3. In being offended at a blow, on in desiring glory so much.
But it is very desirable on account of the other essential goods
which are joined to it; and a man who has received a blow,
without resenting it, is overwhelmed with taunts and indignities.</p>

<p>4. In working for the uncertain; in sailing on the sea; in walking
over a plank.</p>


<h4><a name="p_325" id="p_325"></a>325</h4>

<p>Montaigne is wrong. Custom should be followed only because
it is custom, and not because it is reasonable or just. But
people follow it for this sole reason, that they think it just.
Otherwise they would follow it no longer, although it were the
custom; for they will only submit to reason or justice. Custom
without this would pass for tyranny; but the sovereignty of
reason and justice is no more tyrannical than that of desire.
They are principles natural to man.</p>

<p>It would therefore be right to obey laws and customs, because
they are laws; but we should know that there is neither truth nor
justice to introduce into them, that we know nothing of these,
and so must follow what is accepted. By this means we would
never depart from them. But people cannot accept this
doctrine; and, as they believe that truth can be found, and that
it exists in law and custom, they believe them, and take their
antiquity as a proof of their truth, and not simply of their
authority apart from truth. Thus they obey laws, but they are
liable to revolt when these are proved to be valueless; and this
can be shown of all, looked at from a certain aspect.</p>


<h4><a name="p_326" id="p_326"></a>326</h4>

<p><i>Injustice.</i>—It is dangerous to tell the people that the laws are
unjust; for they obey them only because they think them just.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Therefore it is necessary to tell them at the same time that they
must obey them because they are laws, just as they must obey
superiors, not because they are just, but because they are
superiors. In this way all sedition is prevented, if this can be
made intelligible, and it be understood what is the proper
definition of justice.</p>


<h4><a name="p_327" id="p_327"></a>327</h4>

<p>The world is a good judge of things, for it is in natural
ignorance, which is man's true state.<a name="FNanchor_124_128" id="FNanchor_124_128"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_124_128" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The sciences have two
extremes which meet. The first is the pure natural ignorance in
which all men find themselves at birth. The other extreme is
that reached by great intellects, who, having run through
all that men can know, find they know nothing, and come
back again to that same ignorance from which they set out;
but this is a learned ignorance which is conscious of itself.
Those between the two, who have departed from natural
ignorance and not been able to reach the other, have some
smattering of this vain knowledge, and pretend to be wise.
These trouble the world, and are bad judges of everything.
The people and the wise constitute the world; these despise it,
and are despised. They judge badly of everything, and the
world judges rightly of them.</p>


<h4><a name="p_328" id="p_328"></a>328</h4>

<p><i>The reason of effects.</i>—Continual alternation of pro and con.</p>

<p>We have then shown that man is foolish, by the estimation
he makes of things which are not essential; and all these opinions
are destroyed. We have next shown that all these opinions are
very sound, and that thus, since all these vanities are well
founded, the people are not so foolish as is said. And so we
have destroyed the opinion which destroyed that of the people.</p>

<p>But we must now destroy this last proposition, and show
that it remains always true that the people are foolish, though
their opinions are sound; because they do not perceive the
truth where it is, and, as they place it where it is not, their
opinions are always very false and very unsound.</p>


<h4><a name="p_329" id="p_329"></a>329</h4>

<h4><a name="p_330" id="p_330"></a>330</h4>

<p>The power of kings is founded on the reason and on the folly
of the people, and specially on their folly. The greatest and
most important thing in the world has weakness for its foundation,
and this foundation is wonderfully sure; for there is nothing
more sure than this, that the people will be weak. What is based
on sound reason is very ill founded, as the estimate of wisdom.</p>


<h4><a name="p_331" id="p_331"></a>331</h4>

<p>We can only think of Plato and Aristotle in grand academic
robes. They were honest men, like others, laughing with their
friends, and when they diverted themselves with writing their
<i>Laws</i> and the <i>Politics</i>, they did it as an amusement. That
part of their life was the least philosophic and the least serious;
the most philosophic was to live simply and quietly. If they
wrote on politics, it was as if laying down rules for a lunatic
asylum; and if they presented the appearance of speaking of a
great matter, it was because they knew that the madmen, to
whom they spoke, thought they were kings and emperors. They
entered into their principles in order to make their madness as
little harmful as possible.</p>


<h4><a name="p_332" id="p_332"></a>332</h4>

<p>Tyranny consists in the desire of universal power beyond
its scope.</p>

<p>There are different assemblies of the strong, the fair, the
sensible, the pious, in which each man rules at home, not elsewhere.
And sometimes they meet, and the strong and the fair
foolishly fight as to who shall be master, for their mastery is of
different kinds. They do not understand one another, and their
fault is the desire to rule everywhere. Nothing can effect this,
not even might, which is of no use in the kingdom of the wise,
and is only mistress of external actions.</p>

<p><i>Tyranny</i>— ... So these expressions are false and tyrannical:
"I am fair, therefore I must be feared. I am strong, therefore
I must be loved. I am ..."</p>

<p>Tyranny is the wish to have in one way what can only be had
in another. We render different duties to different merits; the
duty of love to the pleasant; the duty of fear to the strong; the
duty of belief to the learned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>We must render these duties; it is unjust to refuse them, and
unjust to ask others. And so it is false and tyrannical to say,
"He is not strong, therefore I will not esteem him; he is not
able, therefore I will not fear him."</p>


<h4><a name="p_333" id="p_333"></a>333</h4>

<p>Have you never seen people who, in order to complain of the

<p><i>The reason of effects.</i>—It is then true to say that all the world
is under a delusion; for, although the opinions of the people are
sound, they are not so as conceived by them, since they think
the truth to be where it is not. Truth is indeed in their opinions,
but not at the point where they imagine it. [Thus] it is true
that we must honour noblemen, but not because noble birth is
real superiority, etc.</p>


<h4><a name="p_336" id="p_336"></a>336</h4>

<p><i>The reason of effects.</i>—We must keep our thought secret, and
judge everything by it, while talking like the people.</p>


<h4><a name="p_337" id="p_337"></a>337</h4>

<p><i>The reason of effects.</i>—Degrees. The people honour persons
of high birth. The semi-learned despise them, saying that
birth is not a personal, but a chance superiority. The learned
honour them, not for popular reasons, but for secret reasons.
Devout persons, who have more zeal than knowledge, despise
them, in spite of that consideration which makes them honoured
by the learned, because they judge them by a new light which
piety gives them. But perfect Christians honour them by
another and higher light. So arise a succession of opinions for
and against, according to the light one has.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_338" id="p_338"></a>338</h4>

<p>True Christians nevertheless comply with folly, not because
they respect folly, but the command of God, who for the punishment
of men has made them subject to these follies. <i>Omnis

<p>Man is but a reed, the most feeble thing in nature; but he is a
thinking reed. The entire universe need not arm itself to crush
him. A vapour, a drop of water suffices to kill him. But, if
the universe were to crush him, man would still be more noble
than that which killed him, because he knows that he dies and
the advantage which the universe has over him; the universe
knows nothing of this.</p>

<p>All our dignity consists, then, in thought. By it we must

kindness. For otherwise it is not to rise, it is to fall. We do
not display greatness by going to one extreme, but in touching
both at once, and filling all the intervening space. But perhaps
this is only a sudden movement of the soul from one to the
other extreme, and in fact it is ever at one point only, as in

<h4><a name="p_365" id="p_365"></a>365</h4>

<p><i>Thought.</i>—All the dignity of man consists in thought. Thought
is therefore by its nature a wonderful and incomparable thing.
It must have strange defects to be contemptible. But it has
such, so that nothing is more ridiculous. How great it is in its
nature! How vile it is in its defects!</p>

<p>But what is this thought? How foolish it is!</p>


<h4><a name="p_366" id="p_366"></a>366</h4>

<p>The mind of this sovereign judge of the world is not so independent
that it is not liable to be disturbed by the first din
about it. The noise of a cannon is not necessary to hinder its
thoughts; it needs only the creaking of a weathercock or a pulley.
Do not wonder if at present it does not reason well; a fly is
buzzing in its ears; that is enough to render it incapable of good
judgment. If you wish it to be able to reach the truth, chase
away that animal which holds its reason in check and disturbs
that powerful intellect which rules towns and kingdoms. Here
is a comical god! <i>O ridicolosissimo eroe!</i></p>


<h4><a name="p_367" id="p_367"></a>367</h4>

<p>The power of flies; they win battles,<a name="FNanchor_149_153" id="FNanchor_149_153"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_149_153" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> hinder our soul from
acting, eat our body.</p>


<h4><a name="p_368" id="p_368"></a>368</h4>

<p>When it is said that heat is only the motions of certain
molecules, and light the <i>conatus recedendi</i> which we feel,<a name="FNanchor_150_154" id="FNanchor_150_154"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_150_154" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> it
astonishes us. What! Is pleasure only the ballet of our spirits?
We have conceived so different an idea of it! And these sensations
seem so removed from those others which we say are the
same as those with which we compare them! The sensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
from the fire, that warmth which affects us in a manner wholly
different from touch, the reception of sound and light, all this
appears to us mysterious, and yet it is material like the blow of
a stone. It is true that the smallness of the spirits which enter
into the pores touches other nerves, but there are always some
nerves touched.</p>


<h4><a name="p_369" id="p_369"></a>369</h4>

<p>Memory is necessary for all the operations of reason.</p>


<h4><a name="p_370" id="p_370"></a>370</h4>

<p>[Chance gives rise to thoughts, and chance removes them;
no art can keep or acquire them.</p>

<p>A thought has escaped me. I wanted to write it down. I
write instead, that it has escaped me.]</p>


<h4><a name="p_371" id="p_371"></a>371</h4>

<p>[When I was small, I hugged my book; and because it
sometimes happened to me to ... in believing I hugged it,
I doubted....]</p>


<h4><a name="p_372" id="p_372"></a>372</h4>

<p>In writing down my thought, it sometimes escapes me; but
this makes me remember my weakness, that I constantly forget.
This is as instructive to me as my forgotten thought; for I strive
only to know my nothingness.</p>


<h4><a name="p_373" id="p_373"></a>373</h4>

<p><i>Scepticism.</i>—I shall here write my thoughts without order,
and not perhaps in unintentional confusion; that is true order,
which will always indicate my object by its very disorder. I
should do too much honour to my subject, if I treated it with
order, since I want to show that it is incapable of it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_374" id="p_374"></a>374</h4>

<p>What astonishes me most is to see that all the world is not
astonished at its own weakness. Men act seriously, and each
follows his own mode of life, not because it is in fact good to
follow since it is the custom, but as if each man knew certainly
where reason and justice are. They find themselves continually
deceived, and by a comical humility think it is their own fault,
and not that of the art which they claim always to possess. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
it is well there are so many such people in the world, who are
not sceptics for the glory of scepticism, in order to show that
man is quite capable of the most extravagant opinions, since
he is capable of believing that he is not in a state of natural and
inevitable weakness, but, on the contrary, of natural wisdom.
Nothing fortifies scepticism more than that there are some
who are not sceptics; if all were so, they would be wrong.</p>


<h4><a name="p_375" id="p_375"></a>375</h4>

<p>[I have passed a great part of my life believing that there was
justice, and in this I was not mistaken; for there is justice
according as God has willed to reveal it to us. But I did not
take it so, and this is where I made a mistake; for I believed that
our justice was essentially just, and that I had that whereby to
know and judge of it. But I have so often found my right
judgment at fault, that at last I have come to distrust myself,
and then others. I have seen changes in all nations and men,
and thus after many changes of judgment regarding true
justice, I have recognised that our nature was but in continual
change, and I have not changed since; and if I changed, I would
confirm my opinion.</p>

<p>The sceptic Arcesilaus,<a name="FNanchor_151_155" id="FNanchor_151_155"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_151_155" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> who became a dogmatist.]</p>


<h4><a name="p_376" id="p_376"></a>376</h4>

<p>This sect derives more strength from its enemies than from its
friends; for the weakness of man is far more evident in those
who know it not than in those who know it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_377" id="p_377"></a>377</h4>

<p>Discourses on humility are a source of pride in the vain, and
of humility in the humble. So those on scepticism cause believers
to affirm. Few men speak humbly of humility, chastely
of chastity, few doubtingly of scepticism. We are only falsehood,
duplicity, contradiction; we both conceal and disguise
ourselves from ourselves.</p>


<h4><a name="p_378" id="p_378"></a>378</h4>

<p><i>Scepticism.</i>—Excess, like defect of intellect, is accused of
madness. Nothing is good but mediocrity. The majority has
settled that, and finds fault with him who escapes it at whichever
end. I will not oppose it. I quite consent to put myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
there, and refuse to be at the lower end, not because it is low, but
because it is an end; for I would likewise refuse to be placed at
the top. To leave the mean is to abandon humanity. The
greatness of the human soul consists in knowing how to preserve
the mean. So far from greatness consisting in leaving it, it
consists in not leaving it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_379" id="p_379"></a>379</h4>

<p>It is not good to have too much liberty. It is not good to
have all one wants.</p>


<h4><a name="p_380" id="p_380"></a>380</h4>

<p>All good maxims are in the world. We only need to apply
them. For instance, we do not doubt that we ought to risk our
lives in defence of the public good; but for religion, no.</p>

<p>It is true there must be inequality among men; but if this be
conceded, the door is opened not only to the highest power, but
to the highest tyranny.</p>

<p>We must relax our minds a little; but this opens the door to
the greatest debauchery. Let us mark the limits. There are
no limits in things. Laws would put them there, and the mind
cannot suffer it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_381" id="p_381"></a>381</h4>

<p>When we are too young, we do not judge well; so, also, when
we are too old. If we do not think enough, or if we think too
much on any matter, we get obstinate and infatuated about it.
If one considers one's work immediately after having done it,
one is entirely prepossessed in its favour; by delaying too long,
one can no longer enter into the spirit of it. So with pictures
seen from too far or too near; there is but one exact point which
is the true place wherefrom to look at them: the rest are too
near, too far, too high, or too low. Perspective determines
that point in the art of painting. But who shall determine it
in truth and morality?</p>


<h4><a name="p_382" id="p_382"></a>382</h4>

<p>When all is equally agitated, nothing appears to be agitated,
as in a ship. When all tend to debauchery, none appears to do
so. He who stops draws attention to the excess of others,
like a fixed point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_383" id="p_383"></a>383</h4>

<p>The licentious tell men of orderly lives that they stray from
nature's path, while they themselves follow it; as people in a
ship think those move who are on the shore. On all sides the
language is similar. We must have a fixed point in order to
judge. The harbour decides for those who are in a ship; but
where shall we find a harbour in morality?</p>


<h4><a name="p_384" id="p_384"></a>384</h4>

<p>Contradiction is a bad sign of truth; several things which are
certain are contradicted; several things which are false pass
without contradiction. Contradiction is not a sign of falsity,
nor the want of contradiction a sign of truth.</p>


<h4><a name="p_385" id="p_385"></a>385</h4>

<p><i>Scepticism.</i>—Each thing here is partly true and partly false.
Essential truth is not so; it is altogether pure and altogether true.
This mixture dishonours and annihilates it. Nothing is purely
true, and thus nothing is true, meaning by that pure truth.
You will say it is true that homicide is wrong. Yes; for we
know well the wrong and the false. But what will you say is
good? Chastity? I say no; for the world would come to an end.
Marriage? No; continence is better. Not to kill? No; for
lawlessness would be horrible, and the wicked would kill all the
good. To kill? No; for that destroys nature. We possess
truth and goodness only in part, and mingled with falsehood
and evil.</p>


<h4><a name="p_386" id="p_386"></a>386</h4>

<p>If we dreamt the same thing every night, it would affect us
as much as the objects we see every day. And if an artisan
were sure to dream every night for twelve hours' duration that
he was a king, I believe he would be almost as happy as a king,
who should dream every night for twelve hours on end that he
was an artisan.</p>

<p>If we were to dream every night that we were pursued by
enemies, and harassed by these painful phantoms, or that we
passed every day in different occupations, as in making a voyage,
we should suffer almost as much as if it were real, and should
fear to sleep, as we fear to wake when we dread in fact to enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
on such mishaps. And, indeed, it would cause pretty nearly the
same discomforts as the reality.</p>

<p>But since dreams are all different, and each single one is
diversified, what is seen in them affects us much less than what
we see when awake, because of its continuity, which is not,
however, so continuous and level as not to change too; but it
changes less abruptly, except rarely, as when we travel, and
then we say, "It seems to me I am dreaming." For life is a
dream a little less inconstant.</p>


<h4><a name="p_387" id="p_387"></a>387</h4>

<p>[It may be that there are true demonstrations; but this is not
certain. Thus, this proves nothing else but that it is not certain
that all is uncertain, to the glory of scepticism.]</p>


<h4><a name="p_388" id="p_388"></a>388</h4>

<p><i>Good sense.</i>—They are compelled to say, "You are not acting
in good faith; we are not asleep," etc. How I love to see this
proud reason humiliated and suppliant! For this is not the
language of a man whose right is disputed, and who defends it
with the power of armed hands. He is not foolish enough to
declare that men are not acting in good faith, but he punishes
this bad faith with force.</p>


<h4><a name="p_389" id="p_389"></a>389</h4>

<p>Ecclesiastes<a name="FNanchor_152_156" id="FNanchor_152_156"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_152_156" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> shows that man without God is in total ignorance
and inevitable misery. For it is wretched to have the wish,
but not the power. Now he would be happy and assured of
some truth, and yet he can neither know, nor desire not to
know. He cannot even doubt.</p>


<h4><a name="p_390" id="p_390"></a>390</h4>

<p>My God! How foolish this talk is! "Would God have made
the world to damn it? Would He ask so much from persons so
weak?" etc. Scepticism is the cure for this evil, and will take
down this vanity.</p>


<h4><a name="p_391" id="p_391"></a>391</h4>

<p><i>Conversation.</i>—Great words: Religion, I deny it.</p>

<p><i>Conversation.</i>—Scepticism helps religion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_392" id="p_392"></a>392</h4>

<p><i>Against Scepticism.</i>—[ ... It is, then, a strange fact that we
cannot define these things without obscuring them, while we
speak of them with all assurance.] We assume that all conceive
of them in the same way; but we assume it quite gratuitously,
for we have no proof of it. I see, in truth, that the same words
are applied on the same occasions, and that every time two
men see a body change its place, they both express their view
of this same fact by the same word, both saying that it has
moved; and from this conformity of application we derive a
strong conviction of a conformity of ideas. But this is not
absolutely or finally convincing, though there is enough to
support a bet on the affirmative, since we know that we often
draw the same conclusions from different premisses.</p>

<p>This is enough, at least, to obscure the matter; not that it
completely extinguishes the natural light which assures us of
these things. The academicians<a name="FNanchor_153_157" id="FNanchor_153_157"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_153_157" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> would have won. But this
dulls it, and troubles the dogmatists to the glory of the sceptical
crowd, which consists in this doubtful ambiguity, and in a
certain doubtful dimness from which our doubts cannot take
away all the clearness, nor our own natural lights chase away
all the darkness.</p>


<h4><a name="p_393" id="p_393"></a>393</h4>

<p>It is a singular thing to consider that there are people in the
world who, having renounced all the laws of God and nature,
have made laws for themselves which they strictly obey, as,
for instance, the soldiers of Mahomet, robbers, heretics, etc. It
is the same with logicians. It seems that their licence must be
without any limits or barriers, since they have broken through
so many that are so just and sacred.</p>


<h4><a name="p_394" id="p_394"></a>394</h4>

<p>All the principles of sceptics, stoics, atheists, etc., are true.
But their conclusions are false, because the opposite principles
are also true.</p>


<h4><a name="p_395" id="p_395"></a>395</h4>

<p><i>Instinct, reason.</i>—We have an incapacity of proof, insurmountable
by all dogmatism. We have an idea of truth,
invincible to all scepticism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_396" id="p_396"></a>396</h4>

<p>Two things instruct man about his whole nature; instinct
and experience.</p>


<h4><a name="p_397" id="p_397"></a>397</h4>

<p>The greatness of man is great in that he knows himself to be
miserable. A tree does not know itself to be miserable. It is
then being miserable to know oneself to be miserable; but it is
also being great to know that one is miserable.</p>


<h4><a name="p_398" id="p_398"></a>398</h4>

<p>All these same miseries prove man's greatness. They are the
miseries of a great lord, of a deposed king.</p>


<h4><a name="p_399" id="p_399"></a>399</h4>

<p>We are not miserable without feeling it. A ruined house is
not miserable. Man only is miserable. <i>Ego vir videns.</i><a name="FNanchor_154_158" id="FNanchor_154_158"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_154_158" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>


<h4><a name="p_400" id="p_400"></a>400</h4>

<p><i>The greatness of man.</i>—We have so great an idea of the soul
of man that we cannot endure being despised, or not being
esteemed by any soul; and all the happiness of men consists in
this esteem.</p>


<h4><a name="p_401" id="p_401"></a>401</h4>

<p><i>Glory.</i>—The brutes do not admire each other. A horse does
not admire his companion. Not that there is no rivalry between
them in a race, but that is of no consequence; for, when in
the stable, the heaviest and most ill-formed does not give up
his oats to another, as men would have others do to them.
Their virtue is satisfied with itself.</p>


<h4><a name="p_402" id="p_402"></a>402</h4>

<p>The greatness of man even in his lust, to have known how to
extract from it a wonderful code, and to have drawn from it a
picture of benevolence.</p>


<h4><a name="p_403" id="p_403"></a>403</h4>

<p><i>Greatness.</i>—The reasons of effects indicate the greatness of
man, in having extracted so fair an order from lust.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_404" id="p_404"></a>404</h4>

<p>The greatest baseness of man is the pursuit of glory. But
it is also the greatest mark of his excellence; for whatever
possessions he may have on earth, whatever health and essential
comfort, he is not satisfied if he has not the esteem of men. He
values human reason so highly that, whatever advantages he
may have on earth, he is not content if he is not also ranked
highly in the judgment of man. This is the finest position in
the world. Nothing can turn him from that desire, which is the
most indelible quality of man's heart.</p>

<p>And those who most despise men, and put them on a level
with the brutes, yet wish to be admired and believed by men,
and contradict themselves by their own feelings; their nature,
which is stronger than all, convincing them of the greatness of
man more forcibly than reason convinces them of their baseness.</p>


<h4><a name="p_405" id="p_405"></a>405</h4>

<p><i>Contradiction.</i>—Pride counterbalancing all miseries. Man
either hides his miseries, or, if he disclose them, glories in
knowing them.</p>


<h4><a name="p_406" id="p_406"></a>406</h4>

<p>Pride counterbalances and takes away all miseries. Here is
a strange monster, and a very plain aberration. He is fallen
from his place, and is anxiously seeking it. This is what all
men do. Let us see who will have found it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_407" id="p_407"></a>407</h4>

<p>When malice has reason on its side, it becomes proud, and
parades reason in all its splendour. When austerity or stern
choice has not arrived at the true good, and must needs return
to follow nature, it becomes proud by reason of this return.</p>


<h4><a name="p_408" id="p_408"></a>408</h4>

<p>Evil is easy, and has infinite forms; good is almost unique.<a name="FNanchor_155_159" id="FNanchor_155_159"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_155_159" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
But a certain kind of evil is as difficult to find as what we call
good; and often on this account such particular evil gets passed
off as good. An extraordinary greatness of soul is needed in
order to attain to it as well as to good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_409" id="p_409"></a>409</h4>

<p><i>The greatness of man.</i>—The greatness of man is so evident,
that it is even proved by his wretchedness. For what in
animals is nature we call in man wretchedness; by which we
recognise that, his nature being now like that of animals, he has
fallen from a better nature which once was his.</p>

<p>For who is unhappy at not being a king, except a deposed
king? Was Paulus Æmilius<a name="FNanchor_156_160" id="FNanchor_156_160"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_156_160" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> unhappy at being no longer consul?
On the contrary, everybody thought him happy in having been
consul, because the office could only be held for a time. But
men thought Perseus so unhappy in being no longer king, because
the condition of kingship implied his being always king, that they
thought it strange that he endured life. Who is unhappy at
having only one mouth? And who is not unhappy at having
only one eye? Probably no man ever ventured to mourn at not
having three eyes. But any one is inconsolable at having none.</p>


<h4><a name="p_410" id="p_410"></a>410</h4>

<p><i>Perseus, King of Macedon.</i>—Paulus Æmilius reproached
Perseus for not killing himself.</p>


<h4><a name="p_411" id="p_411"></a>411</h4>

<p>Notwithstanding the sight of all our miseries, which press
upon us and take us by the throat, we have an instinct which we
cannot repress, and which lifts us up.</p>


<h4><a name="p_412" id="p_412"></a>412</h4>

<p>There is internal war in man between reason and the passions.</p>

<p>If he had only reason without passions ...</p>

<p>If he had only passions without reason ...</p>

<p>But having both, he cannot be without strife, being unable to
be at peace with the one without being at war with the other.
Thus he is always divided against, and opposed to himself.</p>


<h4><a name="p_413" id="p_413"></a>413</h4>

<p>This internal war of reason against the passions has made a
division of those who would have peace into two sects. The
first would renounce their passions, and become gods; the others
would renounce reason, and become brute beasts. (Des
Barreaux.)<a name="FNanchor_157_161" id="FNanchor_157_161"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_157_161" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> But neither can do so, and reason still remains, to

<p>The nature of man may be viewed in two ways: the one
according to its end, and then he is great and incomparable; the
other according to the multitude, just as we judge of the nature
of the horse and the dog, popularly, by seeing its fleetness, <i>et
animum arcendi</i>; and then man is abject and vile. These are
the two ways which make us judge of him differently, and which
occasion such disputes among philosophers.</p>

<p>For one denies the assumption of the other. One says, "He
is not born for this end, for all his actions are repugnant to it."
The other says, "He forsakes his end, when he does these base
actions."</p>

being deduced from greatness, and greatness from wretchedness,
some have inferred man's wretchedness all the more
because they have taken his greatness as a proof of it, and others
have inferred his greatness with all the more force, because
they have inferred it from his very wretchedness. All that the
one party has been able to say in proof of his greatness has
only served as an argument of his wretchedness to the others,
because the greater our fall, the more wretched we are, and <i>vice
versa.</i> The one party is brought back to the other in an endless
circle, it being certain that in proportion as men possess
light they discover both the greatness and the wretchedness of
man. In a word, man knows that he is wretched. He is
therefore wretched, because he is so; but he is really great
because he knows it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_417" id="p_417"></a>417</h4>

<p>This twofold nature of man is so evident that some have
thought that we had two souls. A single subject seemed to
them incapable of such sudden variations from unmeasured
presumption to a dreadful dejection of heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_418" id="p_418"></a>418</h4>

<p>It is dangerous to make man see too clearly his equality with
the brutes without showing him his greatness. It is also dangerous
to make him see his greatness too clearly, apart from
his vileness. It is still more dangerous to leave him in ignorance
of both. But it is very advantageous to show him both. Man
must not think that he is on a level either with the brutes or
with the angels, nor must he be ignorant of both sides of his
nature; but he must know both.</p>

<p><i>Contraries. After having shown the vileness and the greatness

for there is in him a nature capable of good; but let him not for
this reason love the vileness which is in him. Let him despise
himself, for this capacity is barren; but let him not therefore
despise this natural capacity. Let him hate himself, let him
love himself; he has within him the capacity of knowing the
truth and of being happy, but he possesses no truth, either
constant or satisfactory.</p>

<p>I would then lead man to the desire of finding truth; to be
free from passions, and ready to follow it where he may find it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
knowing how much his knowledge is obscured by the passions.
I would indeed that he should hate in himself the lust which
determined his will by itself, so that it may not blind him in
making his choice, and may not hinder him when he has chosen.</p>

<h3>MORALITY AND DOCTRINE</h3>


<h4><a name="p_425" id="p_425"></a>425</h4>

<p><i>Second part.—That man without faith cannot know the true
good, nor justice.</i></p>

<p>All men seek happiness. This is without exception. Whatever
different means they employ, they all tend to this end.<a name="FNanchor_159_163" id="FNanchor_159_163"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_159_163" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
The cause of some going to war, and of others avoiding it, is the
same desire in both, attended with different views. The will
never takes the least step but to this object. This is the motive
of every action of every man, even of those who hang themselves.</p>

<p>And yet after such a great number of years, no one without
faith has reached the point to which all continually look. All
complain, princes and subjects, noblemen and commoners, old
and young, strong and weak, learned and ignorant, healthy and
sick, of all countries, all times, all ages, and all conditions.</p>

<p>A trial so long, so continuous, and so uniform, should certainly
convince us of our inability to reach the good by our own efforts.
But example teaches us little. No resemblance is ever so perfect
that there is not some slight difference; and hence we expect
that our hope will not be deceived on this occasion as before.
And thus, while the present never satisfies us, experience dupes
us, and from misfortune to misfortune leads us to death, their
eternal crown.</p>

<p>What is it then that this desire and this inability proclaim to
us, but that there was once in man a true happiness of which
there now remain to him only the mark and empty trace, which
he in vain tries to fill from all his surroundings, seeking from
things absent the help he does not obtain in things present?
But these are all inadequate, because the infinite abyss can
only be filled by an infinite and immutable object, that is to say,
only by God Himself.</p>

<p>He only is our true good, and since we have forsaken Him, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
is a strange thing that there is nothing in nature which has not
been serviceable in taking His place; the stars, the heavens,
earth, the elements, plants, cabbages, leeks, animals, insects,
calves, serpents, fever, pestilence, war, famine, vices, adultery,
incest. And since man has lost the true good, everything can
appear equally good to him, even his own destruction, though so
opposed to God, to reason, and to the whole course of nature.</p>

<p>Some seek good in authority, others in scientific research,
others in pleasure. Others, who are in fact nearer the truth,
have considered it necessary that the universal good, which all
men desire, should not consist in any of the particular things
which can only be possessed by one man, and which, when
shared, afflict their possessor more by the want of the part he has
not, than they please him by the possession of what he has.
They have learned that the true good should be such as all can
possess at once, without diminution and without envy, and
which no one can lose against his will. And their reason is that
this desire being natural to man, since it is necessarily in all,
and that it is impossible not to have it, they infer from it ...</p>


<h4><a name="p_426" id="p_426"></a>426</h4>

<p>True nature being lost, everything becomes its own nature;
as the true good being lost, everything becomes its own true good.</p>


<h4><a name="p_427" id="p_427"></a>427</h4>

plainly gone astray, and fallen from his true place without being

everywhere in impenetrable darkness.</p>

incomprehensibility.</i>—The greatness and the wretchedness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
man are so evident that the true religion must necessarily teach
us both that there is in man some great source of greatness, and
a great source of wretchedness. It must then give us a reason
for these astonishing contradictions.</p>

<p>In order to make man happy, it must prove to him that there
is a God; that we ought to love Him; that our true happiness is
to be in Him, and our sole evil to be separated from Him; it
must recognise that we are full of darkness which hinders us
from knowing and loving Him; and that thus, as our duties
compel us to love God, and our lusts turn us away from Him,
we are full of unrighteousness. It must give us an explanation
of our opposition to God and to our own good. It must teach
us the remedies for these infirmities, and the means of obtaining
these remedies. Let us therefore examine all the religions of
the world, and see if there be any other than the Christian which
is sufficient for this purpose.</p>

<p>Shall it be that of the philosophers, who put forward as the
chief good, the good which is in ourselves? Is this the true good?
Have they found the remedy for our ills? Is man's pride cured
by placing him on an equality with God? Have those who have
made us equal to the brutes, or the Mahommedans who have
offered us earthly pleasures as the chief good even in eternity,
produced the remedy for our lusts? What religion, then, will
teach us to cure pride and lust? What religion will in fact teach
us our good, our duties, the weakness which turns us from them,
the cause of this weakness, the remedies which can cure it, and
the means of obtaining these remedies?</p>

<p>All other religions have not been able to do so. Let us see
what the wisdom of God will do.</p>

<p>"Expect neither truth," she says, "nor consolation from men.
I am she who formed you, and who alone can teach you what
you are. But you are now no longer in the state in which I
formed you. I created man holy, innocent, perfect. I filled
him with light and intelligence. I communicated to him my
glory and my wonders. The eye of man saw then the majesty
of God. He was not then in the darkness which blinds him, nor
subject to mortality and the woes which afflict him. But he
has not been able to sustain so great glory without falling into
pride. He wanted to make himself his own centre, and independent
of my help. He withdrew himself from my rule; and,
on his making himself equal to me by the desire of finding his
happiness in himself, I abandoned him to himself. And setting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
in revolt the creatures that were subject to him, I made them
his enemies; so that man is now become like the brutes, and so
estranged from me that there scarce remains to him a dim vision
of his Author. So far has all his knowledge been extinguished
or disturbed! The senses, independent of reason, and often the
masters of reason, have led him into pursuit of pleasure. All
creatures either torment or tempt him, and domineer over him,
either subduing him by their strength, or fascinating him by
their charms, a tyranny more awful and more imperious.</p>

<p>"Such is the state in which men now are. There remains to
them some feeble instinct of the happiness of their former state;
and they are plunged in the evils of their blindness and their
lust, which have become their second nature.</p>

<p>"From this principle which I disclose to you, you can recognise
the cause of those contradictions which have astonished all men,
and have divided them into parties holding so different views.
Observe, now, all the feelings of greatness and glory which the
experience of so many woes cannot stifle, and see if the cause of
them must not be in another nature."</p>

<p><i>For Port-Royal to-morrow (Prosopopœa).</i>—"It is in vain, O
men, that you seek within yourselves the remedy for your ills.
All your light can only reach the knowledge that not in yourselves
will you find truth or good. The philosophers have
promised you that, and have been unable to do it. They
neither know what is your true good, nor what is your true
state. How could they have given remedies for your ills, when
they did not even know them? Your chief maladies are pride,
which takes you away from God, and lust, which binds you to
earth; and they have done nothing else but cherish one or other
of these diseases. If they gave you God as an end, it was only
to administer to your pride; they made you think that you are
by nature like Him, and conformed to Him. And those who
saw the absurdity of this claim put you on another precipice, by
making you understand that your nature was like that of the
brutes, and led you to seek your good in the lusts which are
shared by the animals. This is not the way to cure you of your
unrighteousness, which these wise men never knew. I alone
can make you understand who you are...."</p>

<p>Adam, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>If you are united to God, it is by grace, not by nature. If you
are humbled, it is by penitence, not by nature.</p>

<p>Thus this double capacity ...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>You are not in the state of your creation.</p>

<p>As these two states are open, it is impossible for you not to
recognise them. Follow your own feelings, observe yourselves,
and see if you do not find the lively characteristics of these two
natures. Could so many contradictions be found in a simple
subject?</p>

<p>—Incomprehensible.—Not all that is incomprehensible ceases
to exist. Infinite number. An infinite space equal to a finite.</p>

<p>—Incredible that God should unite Himself to us.—This
consideration is drawn only from the sight of our vileness. But
if you are quite sincere over it, follow it as far as I have done,
and recognise that we are indeed so vile that we are incapable in
ourselves of knowing if His mercy cannot make us capable of
Him. For I would know how this animal, who knows himself
to be so weak, has the right to measure the mercy of God, and
set limits to it, suggested by his own fancy. He has so little
knowledge of what God is, that he does not know what he himself
is, and, completely disturbed at the sight of his own state,
dares to say that God cannot make him capable of communion
with Him.</p>

<p>But I would ask him if God demands anything else from him
than the knowledge and love of Him, and why, since his nature
is capable of love and knowledge, he believes that God cannot
make Himself known and loved by him. Doubtless he knows
at least that he exists, and that he loves something. Therefore,
if he sees anything in the darkness wherein he is, and if he finds
some object of his love among the things on earth, why, if God
impart to him some ray of His essence, will he not be capable of
knowing and of loving Him in the manner in which it shall please
Him to communicate Himself to us? There must then be
certainly an intolerable presumption in arguments of this sort,
although they seem founded on an apparent humility, which is
neither sincere nor reasonable, if it does not make us admit that,
not knowing of ourselves what we are, we can only learn it
from God.</p>

<p>"I do not mean that you should submit your belief to me
without reason, and I do not aspire to overcome you by tyranny.
In fact, I do not claim to give you a reason for everything. And
to reconcile these contradictions, I intend to make you see
clearly, by convincing proofs, those divine signs in me, which
may convince you of what I am, and may gain authority for me
by wonders and proofs which you cannot reject; so that you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
then believe without ... the things which I teach you, since you
will find no other ground for rejecting them, except that you
cannot know of yourselves if they are true or not.</p>

<p>"God has willed to redeem men, and to open salvation to
those who seek it. But men render themselves so unworthy of
it, that it is right that God should refuse to some, because of their
obduracy, what He grants to others from a compassion which is
not due to them. If He had willed to overcome the obstinacy
of the most hardened, He could have done so by revealing Himself
so manifestly to them that they could not have doubted of
the truth of His essence; as it will appear at the last day, with
such thunders and such a convulsion of nature, that the dead
will rise again, and the blindest will see Him.</p>

<p>"It is not in this manner that He has willed to appear in His
advent of mercy, because, as so many make themselves unworthy
of His mercy, He has willed to leave them in the loss of
the good which they do not want. It was not then right that He
should appear in a manner manifestly divine, and completely
capable of convincing all men; but it was also not right that He
should come in so hidden a manner that He could not be known
by those who should sincerely seek Him. He has willed to make
Himself quite recognisable by those; and thus, willing to appear
openly to those who seek Him with all their heart, and to be
hidden from those who flee from Him with all their heart, He
so regulates the knowledge of Himself that He has given signs of
Himself, visible to those who seek Him, and not to those who
seek Him not. There is enough light for those who only desire
to see, and enough obscurity for those who have a contrary
disposition."</p>


<h4><a name="p_431" id="p_431"></a>431</h4>

<p>No other religion has recognised that man is the most excellent
creature. Some, which have quite recognised the reality of his
excellence, have considered as mean and ungrateful the low
opinions which men naturally have of themselves; and others,
which have thoroughly recognised how real is this vileness, have
treated with proud ridicule those feelings of greatness, which
are equally natural to man.</p>

<p>"Lift your eyes to God," say the first; "see Him whom you
resemble, and who has created you to worship Him. You can
make yourselves like unto Him; wisdom will make you equal
to Him, if you will follow it." "Raise your heads, free men,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
says Epictetus. And others say, "Bend your eyes to the earth,
wretched worm that you are, and consider the brutes whose
companion you are."</p>

<p>What, then, will man become? Will he be equal to God or the
brutes? What a frightful difference! What, then, shall we be?
Who does not see from all this that man has gone astray, that he
has fallen from his place, that he anxiously seeks it, that he
cannot find it again? And who shall then direct him to it? The
greatest men have failed.</p>


<h4><a name="p_432" id="p_432"></a>432</h4>

<p>Scepticism is true; for, after all, men before Jesus Christ did
not know where they were, nor whether they were great or
small. And those who have said the one or the other, knew
nothing about it, and guessed without reason and by chance.
They also erred always in excluding the one or the other.</p>

<p><i>Quod ergo ignorantes, quæritis, religio annuntiat vobis.</i><a name="FNanchor_160_164" id="FNanchor_160_164"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_160_164" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>


<h4><a name="p_433" id="p_433"></a>433</h4>

<p><i>After having understood the whole nature of man.</i>—That a
religion may be true, it must have knowledge of our nature.
It ought to know its greatness and littleness, and the reason of
both. What religion but the Christian has known this?</p>


<h4><a name="p_434" id="p_434"></a>434</h4>

<p>The chief arguments of the sceptics—I pass over the lesser
ones—are that we have no certainty of the truth of these
principles apart from faith and revelation, except in so far as
we naturally perceive them in ourselves. Now this natural
intuition is not a convincing proof of their truth; since, having
no certainty, apart from faith, whether man was created by a
good God, or by a wicked demon,<a name="FNanchor_161_165" id="FNanchor_161_165"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_161_165" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> or by chance, it is doubtful
whether these principles given to us are true, or false, or uncertain,
according to our origin. Again, no person is certain, apart from
faith, whether he is awake or sleeps, seeing that during sleep we
believe that we are awake as firmly as we do when we <i>are</i> awake;
we believe that we see space, figure, and motion; we are aware
of the passage of time, we measure it; and in fact we act as if
we were awake. So that half of our life being passed in sleep, we
have on our own admission no idea of truth, whatever we may
imagine. As all our intuitions are then illusions, who knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
whether the other half of our life, in which we think we are awake,
is not another sleep a little different from the former, from which
we awake when we suppose ourselves asleep?</p>

<p>[And who doubts that, if we dreamt in company, and the
dreams chanced to agree, which is common enough, and if we
were always alone when awake, we should believe that matters
were reversed? In short, as we often dream that we dream,
heaping dream upon dream, may it not be that this half of our
life, wherein we think ourselves awake, is itself only a dream on
which the others are grafted, from which we wake at death,
during which we have as few principles of truth and good as
during natural sleep, these different thoughts which disturb us
being perhaps only illusions like the flight of time and the vain
fancies of our dreams?]</p>

<p>These are the chief arguments on one side and the other.</p>

<p>I omit minor ones, such as the sceptical talk against the
impressions of custom, education, manners, country, and the
like. Though these influence the majority of common folk,
who dogmatise only on shallow foundations, they are upset by
the least breath of the sceptics. We have only to see their
books if we are not sufficiently convinced of this, and we shall
very quickly become so, perhaps too much.</p>

<p>I notice the only strong point of the dogmatists, namely, that,
speaking in good faith and sincerely, we cannot doubt natural
principles. Against this the sceptics set up in one word the
uncertainty of our origin, which includes that of our nature.
The dogmatists have been trying to answer this objection ever
since the world began.</p>

<p>So there is open war among men, in which each must take a
part, and side either with dogmatism or scepticism. For he
who thinks to remain neutral is above all a sceptic. This
neutrality is the essence of the sect; he who is not against them
is essentially for them. [In this appears their advantage.]
They are not for themselves; they are neutral, indifferent, in
suspense as to all things, even themselves being no exception.</p>

<p>What then shall man do in this state? Shall he doubt everything?
Shall he doubt whether he is awake, whether he is being
pinched, or whether he is being burned? Shall he doubt whether
he doubts? Shall he doubt whether he exists? We cannot go so
far as that; and I lay it down as a fact that there never has been
a real complete sceptic. Nature sustains our feeble reason, and
prevents it raving to this extent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Shall he then say, on the contrary, that he certainly possesses
truth—he who, when pressed ever so little, can show no title to
it, and is forced to let go his hold?</p>

<p>What a chimera then is man! What a novelty! What a
monster, what a chaos, what a contradiction, what a prodigy!
Judge of all things, imbecile worm of the earth; depositary of
truth, a sink of uncertainty and error; the pride and refuse of
the universe!</p>

<p>Who will unravel this tangle? Nature confutes the sceptics,
and reason confutes the dogmatists. What then will you
become, O men! who try to find out by your natural reason what
is your true condition? You cannot avoid one of these sects, nor
adhere to one of them.</p>

<p>Know then, proud man, what a paradox you are to yourself.
Humble yourself, weak reason; be silent, foolish nature; learn
that man infinitely transcends man, and learn from your Master
your true condition, of which you are ignorant. Hear God.</p>

<p>For in fact, if man had never been corrupt, he would enjoy
in his innocence both truth and happiness with assurance; and
if man had always been corrupt, he would have no idea of truth
or bliss. But, wretched as we are, and more so than if there
were no greatness in our condition, we have an idea of happiness,
and cannot reach it. We perceive an image of truth, and possess
only a lie. Incapable of absolute ignorance and of certain
knowledge, we have thus been manifestly in a degree of perfection
from which we have unhappily fallen.</p>

<p>It is, however, an astonishing thing that the mystery furthest
removed from our knowledge, namely, that of the transmission
of sin, should be a fact without which we can have no knowledge
of ourselves. For it is beyond doubt that there is nothing which
more shocks our reason than to say that the sin of the first man
has rendered guilty those, who, being so removed from this source,
seem incapable of participation in it. This transmission does
not only seem to us impossible, it seems also very unjust. For
what is more contrary to the rules of our miserable justice than
to damn eternally an infant incapable of will, for a sin wherein
he seems to have so little a share, that it was committed six
thousand years before he was in existence? Certainly nothing
offends us more rudely than this doctrine; and yet, without
this mystery, the most incomprehensible of all, we are incomprehensible
to ourselves. The knot of our condition takes
its twists and turns in this abyss, so that man is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
inconceivable without this mystery than this mystery is
inconceivable to man.</p>

<p>[Whence it seems that God, willing to render the difficulty
of our existence unintelligible to ourselves, has concealed the
knot so high, or, better speaking, so low, that we are quite
incapable of reaching it; so that it is not by the proud exertions
of our reason, but by the simple submissions of reason, that we
can truly know ourselves.</p>

<p>These foundations, solidly established on the inviolable
authority of religion, make us know that there are two truths of
faith equally certain: the one, that man, in the state of creation,
or in that of grace, is raised above all nature, made like unto
God and sharing in His divinity; the other, that in the state
of corruption and sin, he is fallen from this state and made like
unto the beasts.</p>

<p>These two propositions are equally sound and certain. Scripture
manifestly declares this to us, when it says in some places:

<p>Without this divine knowledge what could men do but either
become elated by the inner feeling of their past greatness which
still remains to them, or become despondent at the sight of their
present weakness? For, not seeing the whole truth, they could not
attain to perfect virtue. Some considering nature as incorrupt,
others as incurable, they could not escape either pride or sloth, the
two sources of all vice; since they cannot but either abandon
themselves to it through cowardice, or escape it by pride. For if
they knew the excellence of man, they were ignorant of his
corruption; so that they easily avoided sloth, but fell into pride.
And if they recognised the infirmity of nature, they were ignorant
of its dignity; so that they could easily avoid vanity, but it was
to fall into despair. Thence arise the different schools of the
Stoics and Epicureans, the Dogmatists, Academicians, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>The Christian religion alone has been able to cure these two
vices, not by expelling the one through means of the other
according to the wisdom of the world, but by expelling both
according to the simplicity of the Gospel. For it teaches the
righteous that it raises them even to a participation in divinity
itself; that in this lofty state they still carry the source of all
corruption, which renders them during all their life subject to
error, misery, death, and sin; and it proclaims to the most
ungodly that they are capable of the grace of their Redeemer.
So making those tremble whom it justifies, and consoling those
whom it condemns, religion so justly tempers fear with hope
through that double capacity of grace and of sin, common to
all, that it humbles infinitely more than reason alone can do, but
without despair; and it exalts infinitely more than natural pride,
but without inflating; thus making it evident that alone being
exempt from error and vice, it alone fulfils the duty of instructing
and correcting men.</p>

<p>Who then can refuse to believe and adore this heavenly light?
For is it not clearer than day that we perceive within ourselves
ineffaceable marks of excellence? And is it not equally true
that we experience every hour the results of our deplorable
condition? What does this chaos and monstrous confusion
proclaim to us but the truth of these two states, with a voice
so powerful that it is impossible to resist it?</p>

<p><i>Weakness.</i>—Every pursuit of men is to get wealth; and they
cannot have a title to show that they possess it justly, for they
have only that of human caprice; nor have they strength to
hold it securely. It is the same with knowledge, for disease
takes it away. We are incapable both of truth and goodness.</p>

<h4><a name="p_440" id="p_440"></a>440</h4>

<p>The corruption of reason is shown by the existence of so many

<h4><a name="p_441" id="p_441"></a>441</h4>

<p>For myself, I confess that so soon as the Christian religion
reveals the principle that human nature is corrupt and fallen
from God, that opens my eyes to see everywhere the mark of
this truth: for nature is such that she testifies everywhere, both
within man and without him, to a lost God and a corrupt nature.</p>

to the Jews.</i></p>

<p>On the saying in Genesis viii, 21: "The imagination of man's
heart is evil from his youth."</p>

<p><i>R. Moses Haddarschan</i>: This evil leaven is placed in man
from the time that he is formed.</p>

<p><i>Massechet Succa</i>: This evil leaven has seven names in Scripture.
It is called <i>evil, the foreskin, uncleanness, an enemy, a
scandal, a heart of stone, the north wind</i>; all this signifies the
malignity which is concealed and impressed in the heart of man.</p>

<p><i>Midrasch Tillim</i> says the same thing, and that God will
deliver the good nature of man from the evil.</p>

<p>This malignity is renewed every day against man, as it is
written, Psalm xxxvii, 32: "The wicked watcheth the righteous,
and seeketh to slay him"; but God will not abandon him. This
malignity tries the heart of man in this life, and will accuse
him in the other. All this is found in the Talmud.</p>

<p><i>Midrasch Tillim</i> on Psalm iv, 4: "Stand in awe and sin not."
Stand in awe and be afraid of your lust, and it will not lead you
into sin. And on Psalm xxxvi, 1: "The wicked has said within
his own heart, Let not the fear of God be before me." That is
to say that the malignity natural to man has said that to the
wicked.</p>

<p><i>Midrasch el Kohelet</i>: "Better is a poor and wise child than an
old and foolish king who cannot foresee the future."<a name="FNanchor_169_173" id="FNanchor_169_173"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_169_173" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The child
is virtue, and the king is the malignity of man. It is called
king because all the members obey it, and old because it is in
the human heart from infancy to old age, and foolish because
it leads man in the way of [<i>perdition</i>], which he does not foresee.
The same thing is in <i>Midrasch Tillim</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bereschist Rabba</i> on Psalm xxxv, 10: "Lord, all my bones
shall bless Thee, which deliverest the poor from the tyrant."
And is there a greater tyrant than the evil leaven? And on
Proverbs xxv, 21: "If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread
to eat." That is to say, if the evil leaven hunger, give him the
bread of wisdom of which it is spoken in Proverbs ix., and if he
be thirsty, give him the water of which it is spoken in Isaiah lv.</p>

<p><i>Midrasch Tillim</i> says the same thing, and that Scripture in
that passage, speaking of the enemy, means the evil leaven;
and that, in [<i>giving</i>] him that bread and that water, we heap
coals of fire on his head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Midrasch el Kohelet</i> on Ecclesiastes ix, 14: "A great king
besieged a little city." This great king is the evil leaven; the
great bulwarks built against it are temptations; and there has
been found a poor wise man who has delivered it—that is to
say, virtue.</p>

<p>And on Psalm xli, 1: "Blessed is he that considereth the poor."</p>

<p>And on Psalm lxxviii, 39: "The spirit passeth away, and
cometh not again"; whence some have erroneously argued
against the immortality of the soul. But the sense is that this
spirit is the evil leaven, which accompanies man till death, and
will not return at the resurrection.</p>

<p>And on Psalm ciii the same thing.</p>

<p>And on Psalm xvi.</p>

<p>—No; for in acting as we do to oblige everybody, we give no
more occasion for hatred of us.—That is true, if we only hated in
Self the vexation which comes to us from it. But if I hate it
because it is unjust, and because it makes itself the centre of
everything, I shall always hate it.</p>

<p>In a word, the Self has two qualities: it is unjust in itself
since it makes itself the centre of everything; it is inconvenient
to others since it would enslave them; for each Self is the enemy,
and would like to be the tyrant of all others. You take away
its inconvenience, but not its injustice, and so you do not render
it lovable to those who hate injustice; you render it lovable only
to the unjust, who do not any longer find in it an enemy. And
thus you remain unjust, and can please only the unjust.</p>

that a man cannot boast of wealth or knowledge, but it is not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>

easy to convince him that he is wrong to be proud. The proper
place for pride is in wisdom, for it cannot be granted to a man

if they find themselves averse to Him, if they have no inclination
but the desire to establish themselves in the esteem of men, and
if their whole perfection consists only in making men—but
without constraint—find their happiness in loving them, I
declare that this perfection is horrible. What! they have

religion consists in annihilating self before that Universal Being,
whom we have so often provoked, and who can justly destroy
us at any time; in recognising that we can do nothing without

It consists in knowing that there is an unconquerable opposition

though it should be believed with pleasure, and though it should
give me pleasure; even so I am blamable in making myself
loved, and if I attract persons to attach themselves to me. I
ought to warn those who are ready to consent to a lie, that they

body which inspired its life, which would have annihilated it if
it had rejected it and separated it from itself, as it kept itself
apart from the body! What prayers for its preservation in it!
And with what submission would it allow itself to be governed

born unjust, for all tends to self. This is contrary to all order.
We must consider the general good; and the propensity to self
is the beginning of all disorder, in war, in politics, in economy,

depraved.</p>

<p>If the members of natural and civil communities tend towards
the weal of the body, the communities themselves ought to look
to another more general body of which they are members. We
ought therefore to look to the whole. We are therefore born
unjust and depraved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_478" id="p_478"></a>478</h4>

<p>When we want to think of God, is there nothing which turns
us away, and tempts us to think of something else? All this is
bad, and is born in us.</p>


<h4><a name="p_479" id="p_479"></a>479</h4>

<p>If there is a God, we must love Him only, and not the creatures
of a day. The reasoning of the ungodly in the book of Wisdom<a name="FNanchor_179_183" id="FNanchor_179_183"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_179_183" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
is only based upon the non-existence of God. "On that supposition,"
say they, "let us take delight in the creatures."
That is the worst that can happen. But if there were a
God to love, they would not have come to this conclusion, but
to quite the contrary. And this is the conclusion of the wise:
"There is a God, let us therefore not take delight in the
creatures."</p>

<p>Therefore all that incites us to attach ourselves to the creatures
is bad; since it prevents us from serving God if we know Him,
or from seeking Him if we know Him not. Now we are full of
lust. Therefore we are full of evil; therefore we ought to hate
ourselves and all that excited us to attach ourselves to any other
object than God only.</p>

<p>To make the members happy, they must have one will, and
submit it to the body.</p>


<h4><a name="p_481" id="p_481"></a>481</h4>

<p>The examples of the noble deaths of the Lacedæmonians and
others scarce touch us. For what good is it to us? But the
example of the death of the martyrs touches us; for they are
"our members." We have a common tie with them. Their
resolution can form ours, not only by example, but because it
has perhaps deserved ours. There is nothing of this in the
examples of the heathen. We have no tie with them; as we do
not become rich by seeing a stranger who is so, but in fact by
seeing a father or a husband who is so.</p>


<h4><a name="p_482" id="p_482"></a>482</h4>

<p><i>Morality.</i>—God having made the heavens and the earth,
which do not feel the happiness of their being, He has willed to
make beings who should know it, and who should compose a
body of thinking members. For our members do not feel the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
happiness of their union, of their wonderful intelligence, of the
care which has been taken to infuse into them minds, and to make
them grow and endure. How happy they would be if they saw
and felt it! But for this they would need to have intelligence to
know it, and good-will to consent to that of the universal soul.
But if, having received intelligence, they employed it to retain
nourishment for themselves without allowing it to pass to the
other members, they would hate rather than love themselves; their
blessedness, as well as their duty, consisting in their consent to
the guidance of the whole soul to which they belong, which
loves them better than they love themselves.</p>


<h4><a name="p_483" id="p_483"></a>483</h4>

<p>To be a member is to have neither life, being, nor movement,
except through the spirit of the body, and for the body.</p>

<p>The separate member, seeing no longer the body to which it
belongs, has only a perishing and dying existence. Yet it believes
it is a whole, and seeing not the body on which it depends,
it believes it depends only on self, and desires to make itself
both centre and body. But not having in itself a principle of
life, it only goes astray, and is astonished in the uncertainty of
its being; perceiving in fact that it is not a body, and still not
seeing that it is a member of a body. In short, when it comes
to know itself, it has returned as it were to its own home, and
loves itself only for the body. It deplores its past wanderings.</p>

<p>It cannot by its nature love any other thing, except for itself
and to subject it to self, because each thing loves itself more than
all. But in loving the body, it loves itself, because it only exists
in it, by it, and for it. <i>Qui adhæret Deo unus spiritus est.</i><a name="FNanchor_180_184" id="FNanchor_180_184"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_180_184" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The body loves the hand; and the hand, if it had a will, should
love itself in the same way as it is loved by the soul. All love
which goes beyond this is unfair.</p>

<p><i>Adhærens Deo unus spiritus est.</i> We love ourselves, because
we are members of Jesus Christ. We love Jesus Christ, because
He is the body of which we are members. All is one, one is in
the other, like the Three Persons.</p>

<h4><a name="p_485" id="p_485"></a>485</h4>

<p>The true and only virtue, then, is to hate self (for we are hateful
on account of lust), and to seek a truly lovable being to love.
But as we cannot love what is outside ourselves, we must love
a being who is in us, and is not ourselves; and that is true of
each and all men. Now, only the Universal Being is such.
The kingdom of God is within us;<a name="FNanchor_182_186" id="FNanchor_182_186"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_182_186" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> the universal good is within

<p>Every religion is false, which as to its faith does not worship

<h4><a name="p_488" id="p_488"></a>488</h4>

<h4><a name="p_489" id="p_489"></a>489</h4>

<p>If there is one sole source of everything, there is one sole
end of everything; everything through Him, everything for
Him. The true religion, then, must teach us to worship Him
only, and to love Him only. But as we find ourselves unable
to worship what we know not, and to love any other object but
ourselves, the religion which instructs us in these duties must
instruct us also of this inability, and teach us also the remedies
for it. It teaches us that by one man all was lost, and the bond
broken between God and us, and that by one man the bond is
renewed.</p>

<p>We are born so averse to this love of God, and it is so necessary
that we must be born guilty, or God would be unjust.</p>


<h4><a name="p_490" id="p_490"></a>490</h4>

<h4><a name="p_491" id="p_491"></a>491</h4>

<p>The true religion must have as a characteristic the obligation
to love God. This is very just, and yet no other religion has
commanded this; ours has done so. It must also be aware of
human lust and weakness; ours is so. It must have adduced
remedies for this; one is prayer. No other religion has asked of
God to love and follow Him.</p>


<h4><a name="p_492" id="p_492"></a>492</h4>

<p>He who hates not in himself his self-love, and that instinct
which leads him to make himself God, is indeed blinded. Who
does not see that there is nothing so opposed to justice and
truth? For it is false that we deserve this, and it is unfair and
impossible to attain it, since all demand the same thing. It is,
then, a manifest injustice which is innate in us, of which we
cannot get rid, and of which we must get rid.</p>

<p>Yet no religion has indicated that this was a sin; or that we
were born in it; or that we were obliged to resist it; or has
thought of giving us remedies for it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_493" id="p_493"></a>493</h4>

<p>The true religion teaches our duties; our weaknesses, pride,
and lust; and the remedies, humility and mortification.</p>


<h4><a name="p_494" id="p_494"></a>494</h4>

<p>The true religion must teach greatness and misery; must lead
to the esteem and contempt of self, to love and to hate.</p>


<h4><a name="p_495" id="p_495"></a>495</h4>

<h4><a name="p_497" id="p_497"></a>497</h4>

<p><i>Against those who, trusting to the mercy of God, live heedlessly,
without doing good works.</i>—As the two sources of our sins are
pride and sloth, God has revealed to us two of His attributes to
cure them, mercy and justice. The property of justice is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
humble pride, however holy may be our works, <i>et non intres in
judicium</i>,<a name="FNanchor_183_187" id="FNanchor_183_187"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_183_187" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> etc.; and the property of mercy is to combat sloth
by exhorting to good works, according to that passage: "The
goodness of God leadeth to repentance,"<a name="FNanchor_184_188" id="FNanchor_184_188"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_184_188" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> and that other of the
Ninevites: "Let us do penance to see if peradventure He will
pity us."<a name="FNanchor_185_189" id="FNanchor_185_189"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_185_189" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> And thus mercy is so far from authorising slackness,
that it is on the contrary the quality which formally attacks it;
so that instead of saying, "If there were no mercy in God we
should have to make every kind of effort after virtue," we must
say, on the contrary, that it is because there is mercy in God,
that we must make every kind of effort.</p>


<h4><a name="p_498" id="p_498"></a>498</h4>

<p>It is true there is difficulty in entering into godliness. But
this difficulty does not arise from the religion which begins in us,
but from the irreligion which is still there. If our senses were
not opposed to penitence, and if our corruption were not opposed
to the purity of God, there would be nothing in this painful to
us. We suffer only in proportion as the vice which is natural
to us resists supernatural grace. Our heart feels torn asunder
between these opposed efforts. But it would be very unfair to
impute this violence to God, who is drawing us on, instead of
to the world, which is holding us back. It is as a child, which
a mother tears from the arms of robbers, in the pain it suffers,
should love the loving and legitimate violence of her who procures
its liberty, and detest only the impetuous and tyrannical violence
of those who detain it unjustly. The most cruel war which God
can make with men in this life is to leave them without that war
which He came to bring. "I came to send war,"<a name="FNanchor_186_190" id="FNanchor_186_190"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_186_190" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> He says, "and

God loves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

So the righteous man takes for himself nothing of the world,
nor the applause of the world, but only for his passions, which
he uses as their master, saying to the one, "Go," and to another,
"Come." <i>Sub te erit appetitus tuus.</i><a name="FNanchor_190_194" id="FNanchor_190_194"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_190_194" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The passions thus subdued
are virtues. Even God attributes to Himself avarice, jealousy,
anger; and these are virtues as well as kindness, pity, constancy,
which are also passions. We must employ them as slaves, and,
leaving to them their food, prevent the soul from taking any of
it. For, when the passions become masters, they are vices; and
they give their nutriment to the soul, and the soul nourishes
itself upon it, and is poisoned.</p>

corrections. And so in all his other actions he proceeds with
the Spirit of God; and his actions deceive us by reason of the ...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>

<p>The least movement affects all nature; the entire sea changes
because of a rock. Thus in grace, the least action affects
everything by its consequences; therefore everything is important.</p>

<p>In each action we must look beyond the action at our past,

union of two things without change does not enable us to say
that one becomes the other; the soul thus being united to the
body, the fire to the timber, without change. But change is
necessary to make the form of the one become the form of the
other; thus the union of the Word to man. Because my body
without my soul would not make the body of a man; therefore
my soul united to any matter whatsoever will make my body.
It does not distinguish the necessary condition from the sufficient
condition; the union is necessary, but not sufficient. The left
arm is not the right.</p>

<p>Impenetrability is a property of matter.</p>

<p>Identity <i>de numers</i> in regard to the same time requires the

2. To teach us from whom our virtue comes.<br>
3. To make us deserve other virtues by work.<br>
</p>

<p>(But to keep His own pre-eminence, He grants prayer to whom
He pleases.)</p>

<p>Objection: But we believe that we hold prayer of ourselves.</p>

<p>This is absurd; for since, though having faith, we cannot have
virtues, how should we have faith? Is there a greater distance

<p>Saint Augustine has distinctly said that strength would be
taken away from the righteous. But it is by chance that he
said it; for it might have happened that the occasion of saying
it did not present itself. But his principles make us see that
when the occasion for it presented itself, it was impossible that
he should not say it, or that he should say anything to the
contrary. It is then rather that he was forced to say it, when the
occasion presented itself, than that he said it, when the occasion
presented itself, the one being of necessity, the other of chance.
But the two are all that we can ask.</p>

<p>A person told me one day that on coming from confession
he felt great joy and confidence. Another told me that he
remained in fear. Whereupon I thought that these two together
would make one good man, and that each was wanting
in that he had not the feeling of the other. The same often
happens in other things.</p>

<p>He who knows the will of his master will be beaten with more

justice. From him who has received most, will the greatest
reckoning be demanded, because of the power he has by this help.</p>


<h4><a name="p_531" id="p_531"></a>531</h4>

<p>Scripture has provided passages of consolation and of warning
for all conditions.</p>

<p>Nature seems to have done the same thing by her two
infinities, natural and moral; for we shall always have the
higher and the lower, the more clever and the less clever, the
most exalted and the meanest, in order to humble our pride, and
exalt our humility.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

themselves sinners; the rest, sinners, who believe themselves
righteous.</p>


<h4><a name="p_534" id="p_534"></a>534</h4>

<p>We owe a great debt to those who point out faults. For
they mortify us. They teach us that we have been despised.
They do not prevent our being so in the future; for we have
many other faults for which we may be despised. They prepare
for us the exercise of correction and freedom from fault.</p>


<h4><a name="p_535" id="p_535"></a>535</h4>

<p>Man is so made that by continually telling him he is a fool he
believes it, and by continually telling it to himself he makes
himself believe it. For man holds an inward talk with his self
alone, which it behoves him to regulate well: <i>Corrumpunt bonos
mores colloquia prava</i>.<a name="FNanchor_199_203" id="FNanchor_199_203"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_199_203" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> We must keep silent as much as possible
and talk with ourselves only of God, whom we know to be true;
and thus we convince ourselves of the truth.</p>


<h4><a name="p_536" id="p_536"></a>536</h4>

<p>Christianity is strange. It bids man recognise that he is vile,
even abominable, and bids him desire to be like God. Without
such a counterpoise, this dignity would make him horribly vain,
or this humiliation would make him terribly abject.</p>


<h4><a name="p_537" id="p_537"></a>537</h4>

<p>With how little pride does a Christian believe himself united
to God! With how little humiliation does he place himself on a
level with the worms of earth!</p>

<p>A glorious manner to welcome life and death, good and evil!</p>

<p>What difference in point of obedience is there between a
soldier and a Carthusian monk? For both are equally under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
obedience and dependent, both engaged in equally painful
exercises. But the soldier always hopes to command, and never
attains this, for even captains and princes are ever slaves and
dependants; still he ever hopes and ever works to attain this.
Whereas the Carthusian monk makes a vow to be always
dependent. So they do not differ in their perpetual thraldom, in
which both of them always exist, but in the hope, which one
always has, and the other never.</p>


<h4><a name="p_539" id="p_539"></a>539</h4>

<p>The hope which Christians have of possessing an infinite good
is mingled with real enjoyment as well as with fear; for it is not
as with those who should hope for a kingdom, of which they,
being subjects, would have nothing; but they hope for holiness,
for freedom from injustice, and they have something of this.</p>

lovable and happy.</p>

<p><i>Preface.</i>—The metaphysical proofs of God are so remote
from the reasoning of men, and so complicated, that they make
little impression; and if they should be of service to some, it
would be only during the moment that they see such demonstration;
but an hour afterwards they fear they have been
mistaken.</p>

<p><i>Quod curiositate cognoverunt superbia amiserunt.</i><a name="FNanchor_200_204" id="FNanchor_200_204"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_200_204" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>This is the result of the knowledge of God obtained without
Jesus Christ; it is communion without a mediator with the God
whom they have known without a mediator. Whereas those who
have known God by a mediator know their own wretchedness.</p>


<h4><a name="p_543" id="p_543"></a>543</h4>

<p>The God of the Christians is a God who makes the soul feel
that He is her only good, that her only rest is in Him, that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
only delight is in loving Him; and who makes her at the same
time abhor the obstacles which keep her back, and prevent her
from loving God with all her strength. Self-love and lust, which
hinder us, are unbearable to her. Thus God makes her feel that
she has this root of self-love which destroys her, and which He
alone can cure.</p>


<h4><a name="p_544" id="p_544"></a>544</h4>

<p>Jesus Christ did nothing but teach men that they loved
themselves, that they were slaves, blind, sick, wretched, and
sinners; that He must deliver them, enlighten, bless, and heal
them; that this would be effected by hating self, and by following
Him through suffering and the death on the cross.</p>


<h4><a name="p_545" id="p_545"></a>545</h4>

<p>Without Jesus Christ man must be in vice and misery; with
Jesus Christ man is free from vice and misery; in Him is all our
virtue and all our happiness. Apart from Him there is but vice,
misery, darkness, death, despair.</p>


<h4><a name="p_546" id="p_546"></a>546</h4>

<p>We know God only by Jesus Christ. Without this mediator
all communion with God is taken away; through Jesus Christ
we know God. All those who have claimed to know God, and
to prove Him without Jesus Christ, have had only weak proofs.
But in proof of Jesus Christ we have the prophecies, which are
solid and palpable proofs. And these prophecies, being accomplished
and proved true by the event, mark the certainty of
these truths, and therefore the divinity of Christ. In Him then,
and through Him, we know God. Apart from Him, and without
the Scripture, without original sin, without a necessary Mediator
promised and come, we cannot absolutely prove God, nor teach
right doctrine and right morality. But through Jesus Christ,
and in Jesus Christ, we prove God, and teach morality and
doctrine. Jesus Christ is then the true God of men.</p>

<p>But we know at the same time our wretchedness; for this
God is none other than the Saviour of our wretchedness. So we
can only know God well by knowing our iniquities. Therefore
those who have known God, without knowing their wretchedness,
have not glorified Him, but have glorified themselves. <i>Quia ...
non cognovit per sapientiam ... placuit Deo per stultitiam prædicationis

<h4><a name="p_547" id="p_547"></a>547</h4>

<p>Not only do we know God by Jesus Christ alone, but we know
ourselves only by Jesus Christ. We know life and death only
through Jesus Christ. Apart from Jesus Christ, we do not know
what is our life, nor our death, nor God, nor ourselves.</p>

<p>Thus without the Scripture, which has Jesus Christ alone for
its object, we know nothing, and see only darkness and confusion
in the nature of God, and in our own nature.</p>


<h4><a name="p_548" id="p_548"></a>548</h4>

<p>It is not only impossible but useless to know God without
Jesus Christ. They have not departed from Him, but
approached; they have not humbled themselves, but ...</p>

<h4><a name="p_549" id="p_549"></a>549</h4>

<p>I love poverty because He loved it. I love riches because they
afford me the means of helping the very poor. I keep faith with
everybody; I do not render evil to those who wrong me, but I
wish them a lot like mine, in which I receive neither evil nor
good from men. I try to be just, true, sincere, and faithful to
all men; I have a tender heart for those to whom God has more
closely united me; and whether I am alone, or seen of men, I do
all my actions in the sight of God, who must judge of them, and
to whom I have consecrated them all.</p>

<p>These are my sentiments; and every day of my life I bless my
Redeemer, who has implanted them in me, and who, of a man
full of weakness, of miseries, of lust, of pride, and of ambition,
has made a man free from all these evils by the power of His
grace, to which all the glory of it is due, as of myself I have only
misery and error.</p>

<p><i>The Sepulchre of Jesus Christ.</i>—Jesus Christ was dead, but

<p>Jesus Christ was buried by the saints alone.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ wrought no miracle at the Sepulchre.</p>

<p>Only the saints entered it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>It is there, not on the Cross, that Jesus Christ takes a new life.</p>

<p>It is the last mystery of the Passion and the Redemption.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ had nowhere to rest on earth but in the Sepulchre.</p>

<p>His enemies only ceased to persecute Him at the Sepulchre.</p>


<h4><a name="p_552" id="p_552"></a>552</h4>

<p><i>The Mystery of Jesus.</i>—Jesus suffers in His passions the
torments which men inflict upon Him; but in His agony He
suffers the torments which He inflicts on Himself; <i>turbare
semetipsum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_202_206" id="FNanchor_202_206"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_202_206" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> This is a suffering from no human, but an almighty
hand, for He must be almighty to bear it.</p>

<p>Jesus seeks some comfort at least in His three dearest friends,
and they are asleep. He prays them to bear with Him for a
little, and they leave Him with entire indifference, having so little
compassion that it could not prevent their sleeping even for a
moment. And thus Jesus was left alone to the wrath of God.</p>

<p>Jesus is alone on the earth, without any one not only to feel
and share His suffering, but even to know of it; He and Heaven
were alone in that knowledge.</p>

<p>Jesus is in a garden, not of delight as the first Adam, where he
lost himself and the whole human race, but in one of agony,
where He saved Himself and the whole human race.</p>

<p>He suffers this affliction and this desertion in the horror of
night.</p>

<p>I believe that Jesus never complained but on this single
occasion; but then He complained as if he could no longer bear
His extreme suffering. "My soul is sorrowful, even unto death."<a name="FNanchor_203_207" id="FNanchor_203_207"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_203_207" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>Jesus seeks companionship and comfort from men. This is
the sole occasion in all His life, as it seems to me. But He
receives it not, for His disciples are asleep.</p>

<p>Jesus will be in agony even to the end of the world. We
must not sleep during that time.</p>

<p>Jesus, in the midst of this universal desertion, including that
of His own friends chosen to watch with Him, finding them
asleep, is vexed because of the danger to which they expose, not
Him, but themselves; He cautions them for their own safety
and their own good, with a sincere tenderness for them during
their ingratitude, and warns them that the spirit is willing and
the flesh weak.</p>

<p>Jesus, finding them still asleep, without being restrained by
any consideration for themselves or for Him, has the kindness
not to waken them, and leaves them in repose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesus prays, uncertain of the will of His Father, and fears
death; but, when He knows it, He goes forward to offer Himself
to death. <i>Eamus. Processit</i><a name="FNanchor_204_208" id="FNanchor_204_208"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_204_208" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> (John).</p>

<p>Jesus asked of men and was not heard.</p>

<p>Jesus, while His disciples slept, wrought their salvation. He
has wrought that of each of the righteous while they slept, both
in their nothingness before their birth, and in their sins after
their birth.</p>

<p>He prays only once that the cup pass away, and then with
submission; and twice that it come if necessary.</p>

<p>Jesus is weary.</p>

<p>Jesus, seeing all His friends asleep and all His enemies wakeful,
commits Himself entirely to His Father.</p>

<p>Jesus does not regard in Judas his enmity, but the order of
God, which He loves and admits, since He calls him friend.</p>

<p>Jesus tears Himself away from His disciples to enter into His
agony; we must tear ourselves away from our nearest and
dearest to imitate Him.</p>

<p>Jesus being in agony and in the greatest affliction, let us pray
longer.</p>

<p>We implore the mercy of God, not that He may leave us at
peace in our vices, but that He may deliver us from them.</p>

<p>If God gave us masters by His own hand, oh! how necessary
for us to obey them with a good heart! Necessity and events
follow infallibly.</p>

<p>—"Console thyself, thou wouldst not seek Me, if thou hadst

thou wouldst do such and such a thing on an occasion which

<p>"Let thyself be guided by My rules; see how well I have led
the Virgin and the saints who have let Me act in them.</p>

humanity, without thy shedding tears?</p>

<p>"Physicians will not heal thee, for thou wilt die at last. But
it is I who heal thee, and make the body immortal.</p>

I have done for thee more than they, they would not have
suffered what I have suffered from thee, and they would not
have died for thee as I have done in the time of thine infidelities
and cruelties, and as I am ready to do, and do, among my elect
and at the Holy Sacrament."</p>

<p>"If thou knewest thy sins, thou wouldst lose heart."</p>

<p>—I shall lose it then, Lord, for on Thy assurance I believe
their malice.</p>

<p>—"No, for I, by whom thou learnest, can heal thee of them,
and what I say to thee is a sign that I will heal thee. In proportion
to thy expiation of them, thou wilt know them, and it
will be said to thee: 'Behold, thy sins are forgiven thee.' Repent,
then, for thy hidden sins, and for the secret malice of those which
thou knowest."</p>

<p>—Lord, I give Thee all.</p>

<p>—"I love thee more ardently than thou hast loved thine
abominations, <i>ut immundus pro luto</i>.</p>

<p>"To Me be the glory, not to thee, worm of the earth.</p>

<p>"Ask thy confessor, when My own words are to thee occasion
of evil, vanity, or curiosity."</p>

<p>—I see in me depths of pride, curiosity, and lust. There is
no relation between me and God, nor Jesus Christ the Righteous.
But He has been made sin for me; all Thy scourges are fallen
upon Him. He is more abominable than I, and, far from
abhorring me, He holds Himself honoured that I go to Him and
succour Him.</p>

<p>But He has healed Himself, and still more so will He heal me.</p>

<p>I must add my wounds to His, and join myself to Him; and
He will save me in saving Himself. But this must not be
postponed to the future.</p>

<p><i>Eritis sicut dii scientes bonum et malum.</i><a name="FNanchor_205_209" id="FNanchor_205_209"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_205_209" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Each one creates his

life; and do the greatest things as though they were little and

<h4><a name="p_553" id="p_553"></a>553</h4>

must unite ourselves only to His sufferings.</p>

<p>At the Last Supper He gave Himself in communion as about
to die; to the disciples at Emmaus as risen from the dead; to
the whole Church as ascended into heaven.</p>


<h4><a name="p_554" id="p_554"></a>554</h4>

<p>"Compare not thyself with others, but with Me. If thou
dost not find Me in those with whom thou comparest thyself,
thou comparest thyself to one who is abominable. If thou
findest Me in them, compare thyself to Me. But whom wilt
thou compare? Thyself, or Me in thee? If it is thyself, it is one
who is abominable. If it is I, thou comparest Me to Myself.
Now I am God in all.</p>

<p>"I speak to thee, and often counsel thee, because thy director
cannot speak to thee, for I do not want thee to lack a guide.</p>

<p>"And perhaps I do so at his prayers, and thus he leads thee

<h2><a name="SECTION_VIII" id="SECTION_VIII"></a>SECTION VIII</h2>

<h3>THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION</h3>


<h4><a name="p_555" id="p_555"></a>555</h4>

<p>... Men blaspheme what they do not know. The Christian
religion consists in two points. It is of equal concern to men to
know them, and it is equally dangerous to be ignorant to them.
And it is equally of God's mercy that He has given indications
of both.</p>

<p>And yet they take occasion to conclude that one of these
points does not exist, from that which should have caused them
to infer the other. The sages who have said there is only one
God have been persecuted, the Jews were hated, and still more
the Christians. They have seen by the light of nature that if
there be a true religion on earth, the course of all things must
tend to it as to a centre.</p>

<p>The whole course of things must have for its object the
establishment and the greatness of religion. Men must have
within them feelings suited to what religion teaches us. And,
finally, religion must so be the object and centre to which all
things tend, that whoever knows the principles of religion can
give an explanation both of the whole nature of man in particular,
and of the whole course of the world in general.</p>

<p>And on this ground they take occasion to revile the Christian
religion, because they misunderstand it. They imagine that it
consists simply in the worship of a God considered as great,
powerful, and eternal; which is strictly deism, almost as far
removed from the Christian religion as atheism, which is its
exact opposite. And thence they conclude that this religion is
not true, because they do not see that all things concur to the
establishment of this point, that God does not manifest Himself
to men with all the evidence which He could show.</p>

<p>But let them conclude what they will against deism, they will
conclude nothing against the Christian religion, which properly
consists in the mystery of the Redeemer, who, uniting in Himself
the two natures, human and divine, has redeemed men from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
corruption of sin in order to reconcile them in His divine person
to God.</p>

<p>The Christian religion, then, teaches men these two truths;
that there is a God whom men can know, and that there is a
corruption in their nature which renders them unworthy of Him.
It is equally important to men to know both these points; and
it is equally dangerous for man to know God without knowing
his own wretchedness, and to know his own wretchedness without
knowing the Redeemer who can free him from it. The
knowledge of only one of these points gives rise either to the
pride of philosophers, who have known God, and not their own
wretchedness, or to the despair of atheists, who know their own
wretchedness, but not the Redeemer.</p>

<p>And, as it is alike necessary to man to know these two points,
so is it alike merciful of God to have made us know them. The
Christian religion does this; it is in this that it consists.</p>

<p>Let us herein examine the order of the world, and see if all
things do not tend to establish these two chief points of this
religion: Jesus Christ is the end of all, and the centre to which
all tends. Whoever knows Him knows the reason of everything.</p>

<p>Those who fall into error err only through failure to see one of
these two things. We can then have an excellent knowledge of
God without that of our own wretchedness, and of our own
wretchedness without that of God. But we cannot know Jesus
Christ without knowing at the same time both God and our own
wretchedness.</p>

<p>Therefore I shall not undertake here to prove by natural
reasons either the existence of God, or the Trinity, or the immortality
of the soul, or anything of that nature; not only
because I should not feel myself sufficiently able to find in nature
arguments to convince hardened atheists, but also because such
knowledge without Jesus Christ is useless and barren. Though
a man should be convinced that numerical proportions are
immaterial truths, eternal and dependent on a first truth, in
which they subsist, and which is called God, I should not think
him far advanced towards his own salvation.</p>

<p>The God of Christians is not a God who is simply the author
of mathematical truths, or of the order of the elements; that is
the view of heathens and Epicureans. He is not merely a God
who exercises His providence over the life and fortunes of men,
to bestow on those who worship Him a long and happy life.
That was the portion of the Jews. But the God of Abraham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God of Christians, is a
God of love and of comfort, a God who fills the soul and heart of
those whom He possesses, a God who makes them conscious of
their inward wretchedness, and His infinite mercy, who unites
Himself to their inmost soul, who fills it with humility and joy,
with confidence and love, who renders them incapable of any
other end than Himself.</p>

<p>All who seek God without Jesus Christ, and who rest in nature,
either find no light to satisfy them, or come to form for themselves
a means of knowing God and serving Him without a mediator.
Thereby they fall either into atheism, or into deism, two things
which the Christian religion abhors almost equally.</p>

<p>Without Jesus Christ the world would not exist; for it should
needs be either that it would be destroyed or be a hell.</p>

<p>If the world existed to instruct man of God, His divinity
would shine through every part in it in an indisputable manner;
but as it exists only by Jesus Christ, and for Jesus Christ, and
to teach men both their corruption and their redemption, all
displays the proofs of these two truths.</p>

<p>All appearance indicates neither a total exclusion nor a
manifest presence of divinity, but the presence of a God who
hides Himself. Everything bears this character.</p>

<p>... Shall he alone who knows his nature know it only to be
miserable? Shall he alone who knows it be alone unhappy?</p>

<p>... He must not see nothing at all, nor must he see sufficient
for him to believe he possesses it; but he must see enough to
know that he has lost it. For to know of his loss, he must see
and not see; and that is exactly the state in which he naturally is.</p>

<p>... Whatever part he takes, I shall not leave him at rest ...</p>


<h4><a name="p_556" id="p_556"></a>556</h4>

<p>... It is then true that everything teaches man his condition,
but he must understand this well. For it is not true that all
reveals God, and it is not true that all conceals God. But it is
at the same time true that He hides Himself from those who
tempt Him, and that He reveals Himself to those who seek Him,
because men are both unworthy and capable of God; unworthy
by their corruption capable by their original nature.</p>


<h4><a name="p_557" id="p_557"></a>557</h4>

<p>What shall we conclude from all our darkness, but our
unworthiness?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_558" id="p_558"></a>558</h4>

<p>If there never had been any appearance of God, this eternal
deprivation would have been equivocal, and might have as well
corresponded with the absence of all divinity, as with the
unworthiness of men to know Him; but His occasional, though
not continual, appearances remove the ambiguity, If He
appeared once, He exists always; and thus we cannot but
conclude both that there is a God, and that men are unworthy

<h4><a name="p_559" id="p_559"></a>559</h4>

<p>We do not understand the glorious state of Adam, nor the
nature of his sin, nor the transmission of it to us. These are
matters which took place under conditions of a nature altogether
different from our own, and which transcend our present understanding.</p>

<p>The knowledge of all this is useless to us as a means of escape
from it; and all that we are concerned to know, is that we are
miserable, corrupt, separated from God, but ransomed by
Jesus Christ, whereof we have wonderful proofs on earth.</p>

<p>So the two proofs of corruption and redemption are drawn
from the ungodly, who live in indifference to religion, and from
the Jews who are irreconcilable enemies.</p>


<h4><a name="p_560" id="p_560"></a>560</h4>

<p>There are two ways of proving the truths of our religion; one
by the power of reason, the other by the authority of him who
speaks.</p>

<p>We do not make use of the latter, but of the former. We
do not say, "This must be believed, for Scripture, which says
it, is divine." But we say that it must be believed for such and
such a reason, which are feeble arguments, as reason may be
bent to everything.</p>


<h4><a name="p_561" id="p_561"></a>561</h4>

<p>There is nothing on earth that does not show either the
wretchedness of man, or the mercy of God; either the weakness
of man without God, or the strength of man with God.</p>


<h4><a name="p_562" id="p_562"></a>562</h4>

<p>It will be one of the confusions of the damned to see that
they are condemned by their own reason, by which they claimed
to condemn the Christian religion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_563" id="p_563"></a>563</h4>

<p>The prophecies, the very miracles and proofs of our religion,
are not of such a nature that they can be said to be absolutely
convincing. But they are also of such a kind that it cannot be
said that it is unreasonable to believe them. Thus there is
both evidence and obscurity to enlighten some and confuse
others. But the evidence is such that it surpasses, or at least
equals, the evidence to the contrary; so that it is not reason
which can determine men not to follow it, and thus it can only be
lust or malice of heart. And by this means there is sufficient
evidence to condemn, and insufficient to convince; so that it
appears in those who follow it, that it is grace, and not reason,
which makes them follow it; and in those who shun it, that it is
lust, not reason, which makes them shun it.</p>

<h4><a name="p_564" id="p_564"></a>564</h4>

<p>Recognise, then, the truth of religion in the very obscurity
of religion, in the little light we have of it, and in the indifference
which we have to knowing it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_565" id="p_565"></a>565</h4>

<p>We understand nothing of the works of God, if we do not
take as a principle that He has willed to blind some, and enlighten
others.</p>


<h4><a name="p_566" id="p_566"></a>566</h4>

<p>The two contrary reasons. We must begin with that;
without that we understand nothing, and all is heretical; and
we must even add at the end of each truth that the opposite
truth is to be remembered.</p>

<p><i>Objection.</i> The Scripture is plainly full of matters not
dictated by the Holy Spirit.—<i>Answer.</i> Then they do not harm
faith.—<i>Objection.</i> But the Church has decided that all is of the
Holy Spirit.—<i>Answer.</i> I answer two things: first, the Church
has not so decided; secondly, if she should so decide, it could
be maintained.</p>

<p>Do you think that the prophecies cited in the Gospel are
related to make you believe? No, it is to keep you from believing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_568" id="p_568"></a>568</h4>

<p><i>Canonical.</i>—The heretical books in the beginning of the
Church serve to prove the canonical.</p>


<h4><a name="p_569" id="p_569"></a>569</h4>

<p>To the chapter on the <i>Fundamentals</i> must be added that on
<i>Typology</i> touching the reason of types: why Jesus Christ was
prophesied as to His first coming; why prophesied obscurely as
to the manner.</p>


<h4><a name="p_570" id="p_570"></a>570</h4>

<p><i>The reason why. Types.</i>—[They had to deal with a carnal
people and to render them the depositary of the spiritual
covenant.] To give faith to the Messiah, it was necessary there
should have been precedent prophecies, and that these should be
conveyed by persons above suspicion, diligent, faithful, unusually
zealous, and known to all the world.</p>

<p>To accomplish all this, God chose this carnal people, to whom
He entrusted the prophecies which foretell the Messiah as a
deliverer, and as a dispenser of those carnal goods which this
people loved. And thus they have had an extraordinary passion
for their prophets, and, in sight of the whole world, have had
charge of these books which foretell their Messiah, assuring all
nations that He should come, and in the way foretold in the
books, which they held open to the whole world. Yet this
people, deceived by the poor and ignominious advent of the
Messiah, have been His most cruel enemies. So that they, the
people least open to suspicion in the world of favouring us, the
most strict and most zealous that can be named for their law
and their prophets, have kept the books incorrupt. Hence
those who have rejected and crucified Jesus Christ, who has
been to them an offence, are those who have charge of the books
which testify of Him, and state that He will be an offence and
rejected. Therefore they have shown it was He by rejecting
Him, and He has been alike proved both by the righteous Jews
who received Him, and by the unrighteous who rejected Him,
both facts having been foretold.</p>

<p>Wherefore the prophecies have a hidden and spiritual meaning,
to which this people were hostile, under the carnal meaning which
they loved. If the spiritual meaning had been revealed, they
would not have loved it, and, unable to bear it, they would not
have been zealous of the preservation of their books and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
ceremonies; and if they had loved these spiritual promises, and
had preserved them incorrupt till the time of the Messiah, their
testimony would have had no force, because they had been his
friends.</p>

<p>Therefore it was well that the spiritual meaning should be concealed;
but, on the other hand, if this meaning had been so hidden
as not to appear at all, it could not have served as a proof of the
Messiah. What then was done? In a crowd of passages it has
been hidden under the temporal meaning, and in a few has
been clearly revealed; besides that the time and the state of the
world have been so clearly foretold that it is clearer than the
sun. And in some places this spiritual meaning is so clearly
expressed, that it would require a blindness like that which the
flesh imposes on the spirit when it is subdued by it, not to
recognise it.</p>

<p>See, then, what has been the prudence of God. This meaning
is concealed under another in an infinite number of passages,
and in some, though rarely, it is revealed; but yet so that the
passages in which it is concealed are equivocal, and can suit
both meanings; whereas the passages where it is disclosed are
unequivocal, and can only suit the spiritual meaning.</p>

<p>So that this cannot lead us into error, and could only be
misunderstood by so carnal a people.</p>

<p>For when blessings are promised in abundance, what was
to prevent them from understanding the true blessings, but
their covetousness, which limited the meaning to worldly goods?
But those whose only good was in God referred them to
God alone. For there are two principles, which divide the
wills of men, covetousness and charity. Not that covetousness
cannot exist along with faith in God, nor charity with worldly
riches; but covetousness uses God, and enjoys the world, and
charity is the opposite.</p>

<p>Now the ultimate end gives names to things. All which
prevents us from attaining it, is called an enemy to us. Thus
the creatures, however good, are the enemies of the righteous,
when they turn them away from God, and God Himself is the
enemy of those whose covetousness He confounds.</p>

<p>Thus as the significance of the word "enemy" is dependent
on the ultimate end, the righteous understood by it their passions,
and the carnal the Babylonians; and so these terms were obscure
only for the unrighteous. And this is what Isaiah says: <i>Signa
legem in electis meis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_208_212" id="FNanchor_208_212"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_208_212" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> and that Jesus Christ shall be a stone of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
stumbling. But, "Blessed are they who shall not be offended
in him." Hosea,<a name="FNanchor_209_213" id="FNanchor_209_213"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_209_213" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> <i>ult.</i>, says excellently, "Where is the wise?
and he shall understand what I say. The righteous shall know
them, for the ways of God are right; but the transgressors shall
fall therein."</p>

<p><i>Blindness of Scripture.</i>—"The Scripture," said the Jews,
"says that we shall not know whence Christ will come (John vii,
27, and xii, 34). The Scripture says that Christ abideth for ever,
and He said that He should die." Therefore, says Saint John,<a name="FNanchor_210_214" id="FNanchor_210_214"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_210_214" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
they believed not, though He had done so many miracles, that the
word of Isaiah might be fulfilled: "He hath blinded them," etc.</p>


<h4><a name="p_573" id="p_573"></a>573</h4>

<p><i>Greatness.</i>—Religion is so great a thing that it is right that
those who will not take the trouble to seek it, if it be obscure,
should be deprived of it. Why, then, do any complain, if it be
such as can be found by seeking?</p>


<h4><a name="p_574" id="p_574"></a>574</h4>

<p>All things work together for good to the elect, even the
obscurities of Scripture; for they honour them because of what
is divinely clear. And all things work together for evil to the
rest of the world, even what is clear; for they revile such, because
of the obscurities which they do not understand.</p>


<h4><a name="p_575" id="p_575"></a>575</h4>

<p><i>The general conduct of the world towards the Church: God
willing to blind and to enlighten.</i>—The event having proved the
divinity of these prophecies, the rest ought to be believed. And
thereby we see the order of the world to be of this kind. The
miracles of the Creation and the Deluge being forgotten, God
sends the law and the miracles of Moses, the prophets who
prophesied particular things; and to prepare a lasting miracle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
He prepares prophecies and their fulfilment; but, as the
prophecies could be suspected, He desires to make them above
suspicion, etc.</p>


<h4><a name="p_576" id="p_576"></a>576</h4>

<p>God has made the blindness of this people subservient to
the good of the elect.</p>


<h4><a name="p_577" id="p_577"></a>577</h4>

<p>There is sufficient clearness to enlighten the elect, and
sufficient obscurity to humble them. There is sufficient
obscurity to blind the reprobate, and sufficient clearness to
condemn them, and make them inexcusable.—Saint Augustine,
Montaigne, Sébond.</p>

<p>The genealogy of Jesus Christ in the Old Testament is intermingled
with so many others that are useless, that it cannot be
distinguished. If Moses had kept only the record of the ancestors
of Christ, that might have been too plain. If he had not noted
that of Jesus Christ, it might not have been sufficiently plain.
But, after all, whoever looks closely sees that of Jesus Christ
expressly traced through Tamar,<a name="FNanchor_211_215" id="FNanchor_211_215"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_211_215" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Ruth,<a name="FNanchor_212_216" id="FNanchor_212_216"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_212_216" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> etc.</p>

<p>Those who ordained these sacrifices, knew their uselessness;
those who have declared their uselessness, have not ceased to
practise them.</p>

<p>If God had permitted only one religion, it had been too easily
known; but when we look at it closely, we clearly discern the
truth amidst this confusion.</p>

<p><i>The premiss.</i>—Moses was a clever man. If, then, he ruled
himself by his reason, he would say nothing clearly which was
directly against reason.</p>

<p>Thus all the very apparent weaknesses are strength. Example;
the two genealogies in Saint Matthew and Saint Luke. What can
be clearer than that this was not concerted?</p>


<h4><a name="p_578" id="p_578"></a>578</h4>

<p>God (and the Apostles), foreseeing that the seeds of pride
would make heresies spring up, and being unwilling to give them
occasion to arise from correct expressions, has put in Scripture
and the prayers of the Church contrary words and sentences
to produce their fruit in time.</p>

<p>So in morals He gives charity, which produces fruits contrary
to lust.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_579" id="p_579"></a>579</h4>

<p>Nature has some perfections to show that she is the image
of God, and some defects to show that she is only His image.</p>


<h4><a name="p_580" id="p_580"></a>580</h4>

<p>God prefers rather to incline the will than the intellect.
Perfect clearness would be of use to the intellect, and would
harm the will. To humble pride.</p>


<h4><a name="p_581" id="p_581"></a>581</h4>

<p>We make an idol of truth itself; for truth apart from charity
is not God, but His image and idol, which we must neither love
nor worship; and still less must we love or worship its opposite,
namely, falsehood.</p>

<p>I can easily love total darkness; but if God keeps me in a
state of semi-darkness, such partial darkness displeases me, and,
because I do not see therein the advantage of total darkness,
it is unpleasant to me. This is a fault, and a sign that I make
for myself an idol of darkness, apart from the order of God.
Now only His order must be worshipped.</p>


<h4><a name="p_582" id="p_582"></a>582</h4>

<p>The feeble-minded are people who know the truth, but only
affirm it so far as consistent with their own interest. But,
apart from that, they renounce it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_583" id="p_583"></a>583</h4>

<p>The world exists for the exercise of mercy and judgment,
not as if men were placed in it out of the hands of God, but as
hostile to God; and to them He grants by grace sufficient light,
that they may return to Him, if they desire to seek and follow
Him; and also that they may be punished, if they refuse to
seek or follow Him.</p>


<h4><a name="p_584" id="p_584"></a>584</h4>

<p><i>That God has willed to hide Himself.</i>—If there were only one
religion, God would indeed be manifest. The same would be
the case, if there were no martyrs but in our religion.</p>

<p>God being thus hidden, every religion which does not affirm
that God is hidden, is not true; and every religion which does
not give the reason of it, is not instructive. Our religion does,
all this: <i>Vere tu es Deus absconditus.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_585" id="p_585"></a>585</h4>

<p>If there were no obscurity, man would not be sensible of his
corruption; if there were no light, man would not hope for a
remedy. Thus, it is not only fair, but advantageous to us, that
God be partly hidden and partly revealed; since it is equally
dangerous to man to know God without knowing his own
wretchedness, and to know his own wretchedness without
knowing God.</p>


<h4><a name="p_586" id="p_586"></a>586</h4>

<p>This religion, so great in miracles, saints, blameless Fathers,
learned and great witnesses, martyrs, established kings as
David, and Isaiah, a prince of the blood, and so great in science,
after having displayed all her miracles and all her wisdom,
rejects all this, and declares that she has neither wisdom nor
signs, but only the cross and foolishness.</p>

<p>For those, who, by these signs and that wisdom, have deserved
your belief, and who have proved to you their character, declare
to you that nothing of all this can change you, and render you
capable of knowing and loving God, but the power of the foolishness
of the cross without wisdom and signs, and not the signs
without this power. Thus our religion is foolish in respect to
the effective cause, and wise in respect to the wisdom which
prepares it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_587" id="p_587"></a>587</h4>

<p>Our religion is wise and foolish. Wise, because it is the
most learned, and the most founded on miracles, prophecies, etc.
Foolish, because it is not all this which makes us belong to it.
This makes us indeed condemn those who do not belong to it;
but it does not cause belief in those who do belong to it. It is
the cross that makes them believe, <i>ne evacuata sit crux</i>. And
so Saint Paul, who came with wisdom and signs, says that he
has come neither with wisdom nor with signs; for he came to
convert. But those who come only to convince, can say that
they come with wisdom and with signs.</p>

Christ<a name="FNanchor_215_219" id="FNanchor_215_219"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_215_219" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> desires His own testimony to be as nothing.</p>

<h4><a name="p_596" id="p_596"></a>596</h4>

<p><i>Against Mahomet.</i>—The Koran is not more of Mahomet than
the Gospel is of Saint Matthew, for it is cited by many authors
from age to age. Even its very enemies, Celsus and Porphyry,
never denied it.</p>

<p>The Koran says Saint Matthew was an honest man.<a name="FNanchor_216_220" id="FNanchor_216_220"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_216_220" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Therefore
Mahomet was a false prophet for calling honest men wicked,
or for not agreeing with what they have said of Jesus Christ.</p>


<h4><a name="p_597" id="p_597"></a>597</h4>

<p>It is not by that which is obscure in Mahomet, and which
may be interpreted in a mysterious sense, that I would have
him judged, but by what is clear, as his paradise and the rest.
In that he is ridiculous. And since what is clear is ridiculous,
it is not right to take his obscurities for mysteries.</p>

<p>It is not the same with the Scripture. I agree that there are
in it obscurities as strange as those of Mahomet; but there are
admirably clear passages, and the prophecies are manifestly
fulfilled. The cases are therefore not on a par. We must not
confound, and put on one level things which only resemble each
other in their obscurity, and not in the clearness, which requires
us to reverence the obscurities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>In fact the two are so opposed, that if Mahomet took the way
to succeed from a worldly point of view, Jesus Christ, from the
same point of view, took the way to perish. And instead of
concluding that, since Mahomet succeeded, Jesus Christ might
well have succeeded, we ought to say that since Mahomet
succeeded, Jesus Christ should have failed.</p>


<h4><a name="p_599" id="p_599"></a>599</h4>

<p>Any man can do what Mahomet has done; for he performed
no miracles, he was not foretold. No man can do what Christ
has done.</p>


<h4><a name="p_600" id="p_600"></a>600</h4>

<p>The heathen religion has no foundation [at the present day.
It is said once to have had a foundation by the oracles which
spoke. But what are the books which assure us of this?
Are they so worthy of belief on account of the virtue of their
authors? Have they been preserved with such care that we can
be sure that they have not been meddled with?]</p>

<p>The Mahometan religion has for a foundation the Koran and
Mahomet. But has this prophet, who was to be the last hope
of the world, been foretold? What sign has he that every other
man has not, who chooses to call himself a prophet? What
miracles does he himself say that he has done? What mysteries
has he taught, even according to his own tradition? What was
the morality, what the happiness held out by him?</p>

<p>The Jewish religion must be differently regarded in the
tradition of the Holy Bible, and in the tradition of the people.
Its morality and happiness are absurd in the tradition of the
people, but are admirable in that of the Holy Bible. (And all
religion is the same; for the Christian religion is very different
in the Holy Bible and in the casuists.) The foundation is
admirable; it is the most ancient book in the world, and the
most authentic; and whereas Mahomet, in order to make his
own book continue in existence, forbade men to read it, Moses,<a name="FNanchor_217_221" id="FNanchor_217_221"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_217_221" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
for the same reason, ordered every one to read his.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Our religion is so divine that another divine religion has only
been the foundation of it.</p>

<h4><a name="p_602" id="p_602"></a>602</h4>

<p>The Jewish religion is wholly divine in its authority, its
duration, its perpetuity, its morality, its doctrine, and its effects.</p>


<h4><a name="p_603" id="p_603"></a>603</h4>

<p>The only science contrary to common sense and human
nature is that alone which has always existed among men.</p>

<p>The only religion contrary to nature, to common sense, and
to our pleasure, is that alone which has always existed.</p>


<h4><a name="p_605" id="p_605"></a>605</h4>

<p>No religion but our own has taught that man is born in sin.
No sect of philosophers has said this. Therefore none have
declared the truth.</p>

<p>No sect or religion has always existed on earth, but the
Christian religion.</p>


<h4><a name="p_606" id="p_606"></a>606</h4>

<p>Whoever judges of the Jewish religion by its coarser forms
will misunderstand it. It is to be seen in the Holy Bible, and in
the tradition of the prophets, who have made it plain enough
that they did not interpret the law according to the letter. So
our religion is divine in the Gospel, in the Apostles, and in
tradition; but it is absurd in those who tamper with it.</p>

<p>The Messiah, according to the carnal Jews, was to be a great
temporal prince. Jesus Christ, according to carnal Christians,<a name="FNanchor_218_222" id="FNanchor_218_222"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_218_222" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
has come to dispense us from the love of God, and to give us
sacraments which shall do everything without our help. Such
is not the Christian religion, nor the Jewish. True Jews and
true Christians have always expected a Messiah who should
make them love God, and by that love triumph over their
enemies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_607" id="p_607"></a>607</h4>

<p>The carnal Jews hold a midway place between Christians
and heathens. The heathens know not God, and love the
world only. The Jews know the true God, and love the world
only. The Christians know the true God, and love not the
world. Jews and heathens love the same good. Jews and
Christians know the same God.</p>

<p>The Jews were of two kinds; the first had only heathen
affections, the other had Christian affections.</p>


<h4><a name="p_608" id="p_608"></a>608</h4>

<p>There are two kinds of men in each religion: among the
heathen, worshippers of beasts, and the worshippers of the one
only God of natural religion; among the Jews, the carnal, and
the spiritual, who were the Christians of the old law; among
Christians, the coarser-minded, who are the Jews of the new
law. The carnal Jews looked for a carnal Messiah; the coarser
Christians believe that the Messiah has dispensed them from the
love of God; true Jews and true Christians worship a Messiah
who makes them love God.</p>


<h4><a name="p_609" id="p_609"></a>609</h4>

<p><i>To show that the true Jews and the true Christians have but
the same religion.</i>—The religion of the Jews seemed to consist
essentially in the fatherhood of Abraham, in circumcision, in
sacrifices, in ceremonies, in the Ark, in the temple, in Jerusalem,
and, finally, in the law, and in the covenant with Moses.</p>

<p>I say that it consisted in none of those things, but only in the
love of God, and that God disregarded all the other things.</p>

<p>That God did not accept the posterity of Abraham.</p>

<p>That the Jews were to be punished like strangers, if they
transgressed. <i>Deut.</i> viii, 19; "If thou do at all forget the Lord
thy God, and walk after other gods, I testify against you this
day that ye shall surely perish, as the nations which the Lord
destroyeth before your face."</p>

<p>That strangers, if they loved God, were to be received by Him
as the Jews. <i>Isaiah</i> lvi, 3: "Let not the stranger say, 'The
Lord will not receive me.' The strangers who join themselves
unto the Lord to serve Him and love Him, will I bring unto my
holy mountain, and accept therein sacrifices, for mine house is
a house of prayer."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>That the true Jews considered their merit to be from God
only, and not from Abraham. <i>Isaiah</i> lxiii, 16; "Doubtless
thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and
Israel acknowledge us not. Thou art our Father and our
Redeemer."</p>

<p>Moses himself told them that God would not accept persons.
<i>Deut.</i> x, 17: "God," said he, "regardeth neither persons nor
sacrifices."</p>

<p>The Sabbath was only a sign, <i>Exod.</i> xxxi, 13; and in memory
of the escape from Egypt, <i>Deut.</i> v, 19. Therefore it is no longer
necessary, since Egypt must be forgotten.</p>

<p>Circumcision was only a sign, <i>Gen.</i> xvii, 11. And thence it
came to pass that, being in the desert, they were not circumcised
because they could not be confounded with other peoples; and
after Jesus Christ came, it was no longer necessary.</p>

<p>That the circumcision of the heart is commanded. <i>Deut.</i>
x, 16; <i>Jeremiah</i> iv, 4: "Be ye circumcised in heart; take away
the superfluities of your heart, and harden yourselves not. For
your God is a mighty God, strong and terrible, who accepteth
not persons."</p>

<p>That God said He would one day do it. <i>Deut.</i> xxx, 6; "God
will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, that thou
mayest love Him with all thine heart."</p>

<p>That the uncircumcised in heart shall be judged. <i>Jeremiah</i>
ix, 26: For God will judge the uncircumcised peoples, and all
the people of Israel, because he is "uncircumcised in heart."</p>

<p>That the external is of no avail apart from the internal.
<i>Joel</i> ii, 13: <i>Scindite corda vestra</i>, etc.; <i>Isaiah</i> lviii, 3, 4, etc.</p>

<p>The love of God is enjoined in the whole of Deuteronomy.
<i>Deut.</i> xxx, 19: "I call heaven and earth to record that I have
set before you life and death, that you should choose life, and
love God, and obey Him, for God is your life."</p>

<p>That the Jews, for lack of that love, should be rejected for
their offences, and the heathen chosen in their stead. <i>Hosea</i> i,
10; <i>Deut.</i> xxxii, 20. "I will hide myself from them in view of
their latter sins, for they are a froward generation without faith.
They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God,
and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not
a people, and with an ignorant and foolish nation." <i>Isaiah</i> lxv, 1.</p>

<p>That temporal goods are false, and that the true good is to
be united to God. <i>Psalm</i> cxliii, 15.</p>

<p>That their feasts are displeasing to God. <i>Amos</i> v, 21.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>That the sacrifices of the Jews displeased God. <i>Isaiah</i> lxvi.
1-3; i, II; <i>Jer.</i> vi, 20; David, <i>Miserere.</i>—Even on the part of
the good, <i>Expectavi</i>. <i>Psalm</i> xlix, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.</p>

<p>That He has established them only for their hardness. <i>Micah</i>,
admirably, vi; 1 <i>Kings</i> xv, 22; <i>Hosea</i> vi, 6.</p>

<p>That the sacrifices of the Gentiles will be accepted of God,
and that God will take no pleasure in the sacrifices of the Jews.
<i>Malachi</i> i, II.</p>

<p>That God will make a new covenant with the Messiah, and
the old will be annulled. <i>Jer.</i> xxxi, 31. <i>Mandata non bona. Ezek.</i></p>

<p>That the old things will be forgotten. <i>Isaiah</i> xliii, 18, 19;
lxv 17, 10.</p>

<p>That the Ark will no longer be remembered. <i>Jer.</i> iii, 15, 16.</p>

<p>That the temple should be rejected. <i>Jer.</i> vii, 12, 13, 14.</p>

<p>That the sacrifices should be rejected, and other pure sacrifices
established. <i>Malachi</i> i, II.</p>

<p>That the order of Aaron's priesthood should be rejected, and
that of Melchizedek introduced by the Messiah. <i>Ps. Dixit
Dominus.</i></p>

<p>That this priesthood should be eternal. <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p>That Jerusalem should be rejected, and Rome admitted.
<i>Ps. Dixit Dominus.</i></p>

<p>That the name of the Jews should be rejected, and a new
name given. <i>Isaiah</i> lxv, 15.</p>

<p>That this last name should be more excellent than that of the
Jews, and eternal. <i>Isaiah</i> lvi, 5.</p>

<p>That the Jews should be without prophets (Amos), without
a king, without princes, without sacrifice, without an idol.</p>

<p>That the Jews should nevertheless always remain a people.
<i>Jer.</i> xxxi, 36.</p>


<h4><a name="p_610" id="p_610"></a>610</h4>

<p><i>Republic.</i>—The Christian republic—and even the Jewish—has
only had God for ruler, as Philo the Jew notices, <i>On Monarchy</i>.</p>

<p>When they fought, it was for God only; their chief hope was
in God only; they considered their towns as belonging to God
only, and kept them for God. 1 <i>Chron.</i> xix, 13.</p>

<h4><a name="p_612" id="p_612"></a>612</h4>

<p><i>Perpetuity.</i>—That religion has always existed on earth, which
consists in believing that man has fallen from a state of glory
and of communion with God into a state of sorrow, penitence,
and estrangement from God, but that after this life we shall be
restored by a Messiah who should have come. All things have
passed away, and this has endured, for which all things are.</p>

<p>Men have in the first age of the world been carried away into
every kind of debauchery, and yet there were saints, as Enoch,
Lamech, and others, who waited patiently for the Christ promised
from the beginning of the world. Noah saw the wickedness of
men at its height; and he was held worthy to save the world in
his person, by the hope of the Messiah of whom he was the type.
Abraham was surrounded by idolaters, when God made known
to him the mystery of the Messiah, whom he welcomed from
afar.<a name="FNanchor_219_223" id="FNanchor_219_223"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_219_223" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> In the time of Isaac and Jacob abomination was spread
over all the earth; but these saints lived in faith; and Jacob,
dying and blessing his children, cried in a transport which made
him break off his discourse, "I await, O my God, the Saviour
whom Thou hast promised. <i>Salutare taum expectabo, Domine.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_220_224" id="FNanchor_220_224"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_220_224" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
The Egyptians were infected both with idolatry and magic; the
very people of God were led astray by their example. Yet Moses
and others believed Him whom they saw not, and worshipped
Him, looking to the eternal gifts which He was preparing for
them.</p>

<p>The Greeks and Latins then set up false deities; the poets
made a hundred different theologies, while the philosophers
separated into a thousand different sects; and yet in the heart of
Judæa there were always chosen men who foretold the coming
of this Messiah, which was known to them alone.</p>

<p>He came at length in the fullness of time, and time has since
witnessed the birth of so many schisms and heresies, so many
political revolutions, so many changes in all things; yet this
Church, which worships Him who has always been worshipped,
has endured uninterruptedly. It is a wonderful, incomparable,
and altogether divine fact that this religion, which has always
endured, has always been attacked. It has been a thousand
times on the eve of universal destruction, and every time it has
been in that state, God has restored it by extraordinary acts of
His power. This is astonishing, as also that it has preserved
itself without yielding to the will of tyrants. For it is not
strange that a State endures, when its laws are sometimes made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
to give way to necessity, but that ... (See the passage indicated
in Montaigne.)</p>


<h4><a name="p_613" id="p_613"></a>613</h4>

<p>States would perish if they did not often make their laws give
way to necessity. But religion has never suffered this, or practised
it. Indeed, there must be these compromises, or miracles.
It is not strange to be saved by yieldings, and this is not strictly
self-preservation; besides, in the end they perish entirely. None
has endured a thousand years. But the fact that this religion
has always maintained itself, inflexible as it is, proves its divinity.</p>


<h4><a name="p_614" id="p_614"></a>614</h4>

<p>Whatever may be said, it must be admitted that the Christian
religion has something astonishing in it. Some will say, "This
is because you were born in it." Far from it; I stiffen myself
against it for this very reason, for fear this prejudice bias me.
But although I am born in it, I cannot help finding it so.</p>


<h4><a name="p_615" id="p_615"></a>615</h4>

<p><i>Perpetuity.</i>—The Messiah has always been believed in. The
tradition from Adam was fresh in Noah and in Moses. Since
then the prophets have foretold him, while at the same time
foretelling other things, which, being from time to time fulfilled
in the sight of men, showed the truth of their mission, and
consequently that of their promises touching the Messiah.
Jesus Christ performed miracles, and the Apostles also, who
converted all the heathen; and all the prophecies being thereby
fulfilled, the Messiah is for ever proved.</p>


<h4><a name="p_616" id="p_616"></a>616</h4>

<p><i>Perpetuity.</i>—Let us consider that since the beginning of the
world the expectation of worship of the Messiah has existed
uninterruptedly; that there have been found men, who said that
God had revealed to them that a Redeemer was to be born, who
should save His people; that Abraham came afterwards, saying
that he had had a revelation that the Messiah was to spring from
him by a son, whom he should have; that Jacob declared that,
of his twelve sons, the Messiah would spring from Judah; that
Moses and the prophets then came to declare the time and the
manner of His coming; that they said their law was only
temporary till that of the Messiah, that it should endure till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
then, but that the other should last for ever; that thus either
their law, or that of the Messiah, of which it was the promise,
would be always upon the earth; that, in fact, it has always
endured; that at last Jesus Christ came with all the circumstances
foretold. This is wonderful.</p>


<h4><a name="p_617" id="p_617"></a>617</h4>

<p>This is positive fact. While all philosophers separate into
different sects, there is found in one corner of the world the
most ancient people in it, declaring that all the world is in error,
that God has revealed to them the truth, that they will always
exist on the earth. In fact, all other sects come to an end, this
one still endures, and has done so for four thousand years.</p>

<p>They declare that they hold from their ancestors that man
has fallen from communion with God, and is entirely estranged
from God, but that He has promised to redeem them; that this
doctrine shall always exist on the earth; that their law has a
double signification; that during sixteen hundred years they
have had people, whom they believed prophets, foretelling both
the time and the manner; that four hundred years after they were
scattered everywhere, because Jesus Christ was to be everywhere
announced; that Jesus Christ came in the manner, and at the
time foretold; that the Jews have since been scattered abroad
under a curse, and nevertheless still exist.</p>


<h4><a name="p_618" id="p_618"></a>618</h4>

<p>I see the Christian religion founded upon a preceding religion,
and this is what I find as a fact.</p>

<p>I do not here speak of the miracles of Moses, of Jesus Christ,
and of the Apostles, because they do not at first seem convincing,
and because I only wish here to put in evidence all
those foundations of the Christian religion which are beyond
doubt, and which cannot be called in question by any person
whatsoever. It is certain that we see in many places of the
world a peculiar people, separated from all other peoples of the
world, and called the Jewish people.</p>

<p>I see then a crowd of religions in many parts of the world
and in all times; but their morality cannot please me, nor can
their proofs convince me. Thus I should equally have rejected
the religion of Mahomet and of China, of the ancient Romans
and of the Egyptians, for the sole reason, that none having more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
marks of truth than another, nor anything which should necessarily
persuade me, reason cannot incline to one rather than the
other.</p>

<p>But, in thus considering this changeable and singular variety
of morals and beliefs at different times, I find in one corner of
the world a peculiar people, separated from all other peoples
on earth, the most ancient of all, and whose histories are earlier
by many generations than the most ancient which we possess.</p>

<p>I find, then, this great and numerous people, sprung from a
single man, who worship one God, and guide themselves by a
law which they say that they obtained from His own hand.
They maintain that they are the only people in the world to
whom God has revealed His mysteries; that all men are corrupt
and in disgrace with God; that they are all abandoned to their
senses and their own imagination, whence come the strange
errors and continual changes which happen among them, both
of religions and of morals, whereas they themselves remain
firm in their conduct; but that God will not leave other nations
in this darkness for ever; that there will come a Saviour for all;
that they are in the world to announce Him to men; that they
are expressly formed to be forerunners and heralds of this great
event, and to summon all nations to join with them in the
expectation of this Saviour.</p>

<p>To meet with this people is astonishing to me, and seems to
me worthy of attention. I look at the law which they boast of
having obtained from God, and I find it admirable. It is the
first law of all, and is of such a kind that, even before the term
<i>law</i> was in currency among the Greeks, it had, for nearly a
thousand years earlier, been uninterruptedly accepted and
observed by the Jews. I likewise think it strange that the
first law of the world happens to be the most perfect; so that the
greatest legislators have borrowed their laws from it, as is
apparent from the law of the Twelve Tables at Athens,<a name="FNanchor_221_225" id="FNanchor_221_225"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_221_225" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> afterwards
taken by the Romans, and as it would be easy to prove,
if Josephus<a name="FNanchor_222_226" id="FNanchor_222_226"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_222_226" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> and others had not sufficiently dealt with this
subject.</p>


<h4><a name="p_619" id="p_619"></a>619</h4>

<p><i>Advantages of the Jewish people.</i>—In this search the Jewish
people at once attracts my attention by the number of wonderful
and singular facts which appear about them.</p>

<p>I first see that they are a people wholly composed of brethren,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and whereas all others are formed by the assemblage of an
infinity of families, this, though so wonderfully fruitful, has all
sprung from one man alone, and, being thus all one flesh, and
members one of another, they constitute a powerful state of one
family. This is unique.</p>

<p>This family, or people, is the most ancient within human
knowledge, a fact which seems to me to inspire a peculiar
veneration for it, especially in view of our present inquiry;
since if God had from all time revealed Himself to men, it is to
these we must turn for knowledge of the tradition.</p>

<p>This people is not eminent solely by their antiquity, but is
also singular by their duration, which has always continued
from their origin till now. For whereas the nations of Greece
and of Italy, of Lacedæmon, of Athens and of Rome, and others
who came long after, have long since perished, these ever remain,
and in spite of the endeavours of many powerful kings who have
a hundred times tried to destroy them, as their historians testify,
and as it is easy to conjecture from the natural order of things
during so long a space of years, they have nevertheless been
preserved (and this preservation has been foretold); and
extending from the earliest times to the latest, their history
comprehends in its duration all our histories [which it preceded
by a long time].</p>

<p>The law by which this people is governed is at once the most
ancient law in the world, the most perfect, and the only one
which has been always observed without a break in a state.
This is what Josephus admirably proves, <i>against Apion</i>,<a name="FNanchor_223_227" id="FNanchor_223_227"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_223_227" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> and
also Philo<a name="FNanchor_224_228" id="FNanchor_224_228"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_224_228" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> the Jew, in different places, where they point out that
it is so ancient that the very name of <i>law</i> was only known by the
oldest nation more than a thousand years afterwards; so that
Homer, who has written the history of so many states, has
never used the term. And it is easy to judge of its perfection
by simply reading it; for we see that it has provided for all
things with so great wisdom, equity, and judgment, that the
most ancient legislators, Greek and Roman, having had some
knowledge of it, have borrowed from it their principal laws;
this is evident from what are called the Twelve Tables, and from
the other proofs which Josephus gives.</p>

<p>But this law is at the same time the severest and strictest of
all in respect to their religious worship, imposing on this people,
in order to keep them to their duty, a thousand peculiar and
painful observances, on pain of death. Whence it is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
astonishing that it has been constantly preserved during many
centuries by a people, rebellious and impatient as this one
was; while all other states have changed their laws from time
to time, although these were far more lenient.</p>

<p>The book which contains this law, the first of all, is itself the
most ancient book in the world, those of Homer, Hesiod, and
others, being six or seven hundred years later.</p>


<h4><a name="p_620" id="p_620"></a>620</h4>

<p>The creation and the deluge being past, and God no longer
requiring to destroy the world, nor to create it anew, nor to give
such great signs of Himself, He began to establish a people on the
earth, purposely formed, who were to last until the coming of
the people whom the Messiah should fashion by His spirit.</p>


<h4><a name="p_621" id="p_621"></a>621</h4>

<p>The creation of the world beginning to be distant, God provided
a single contemporary historian, and appointed a whole

be known through that means.</p>

<p>Why should Moses make the lives of men so long, and their
generations so few?</p>

<p>Because it is not the length of years, but the multitude of
generations, which renders things obscure. For truth is perverted
only by the change of men. And yet he puts two things,
the most memorable that were ever imagined, namely, the
creation and the deluge, so near that we reach from one to the
other.</p>


<h4><a name="p_624" id="p_624"></a>624</h4>

<p>Shem, who saw Lamech, who saw Adam, saw also Jacob, who
saw those who saw Moses; therefore the deluge and the creation
are true. This is conclusive among certain people who understand
it rightly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_625" id="p_625"></a>625</h4>

<p>The longevity of the patriarchs, instead of causing the loss
of past history, conduced, on the contrary, to its preservation.
For the reason why we are sometimes insufficiently instructed
in the history of our ancestors, is that we have never lived long
with them, and that they are often dead before we have attained
the age of reason. Now, when men lived so long, children
lived long with their parents. They conversed long with them.
But what else could be the subject of their talk save the history
of their ancestors, since to that all history was reduced, and men
did not study science or art, which now form a large part of
daily conversation? We see also that in these days tribes took
particular care to preserve their genealogies.</p>

<p><i>Antiquity of the Jews.</i>—What a difference there is between
one book and another! I am not astonished that the Greeks
made the Iliad, nor the Egyptians and the Chinese their histories.</p>

<p>We have only to see how this originates. These fabulous
historians are not contemporaneous with the facts about which
they write. Homer composes a romance, which he gives out as
such, and which is received as such; for nobody doubted that
Troy and Agamemnon no more existed than did the golden
apple. Accordingly he did not think of making a history, but
solely a book to amuse; he is the only writer of his time; the
beauty of the work has made it last, every one learns it and
talks of it, it is necessary to know it, and each one knows it by
heart. Four hundred years afterwards the witnesses of these
facts are no longer alive, no one knows of his own knowledge
if it be a fable or a history; one has only learnt it from his
ancestors, and this can pass for truth.</p>

<p>Every history which is not contemporaneous, as the books
of the Sibyls and Trismegistus,<a name="FNanchor_226_230" id="FNanchor_226_230"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_226_230" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and so many others which have
been believed by the world, are false, and found to be false in
the course of time. It is not so with contemporaneous writers.</p>

<p>There is a great difference between a book which an individual
writes, and publishes to a nation, and a book which itself creates
a nation. We cannot doubt that the book is as old as the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

have offended Him by worshipping gods who were not their
God, so He will provoke them by calling a people who are not
His people; that He desires that all His words be preserved for
ever, and that His book be placed in the Ark of the Covenant
to serve for ever as a witness against them.</p>

<p>Isaiah says the same thing, xxx.</p>

<p><i>On Esdras.</i>—The story that the books were burnt with the
temple proved false by Maccabees: "Jeremiah gave them
the law."</p>

<p>The story that he recited the whole by heart. Josephus
and Esdras point out <i>that he read the book</i>. Baronius, <i>Ann.</i>, p.
180: <i>Nullus penitus Hebræorum antiquorum reperitur qui

<p>Josephus says that the Law was in Hebrew when it was
translated by the Seventy.</p>

<p>Under Antiochus and Vespasian, when they wanted to
abolish the books, and when there was no prophet, they could
not do so. And under the Babylonians, when no persecution
had been made, and when there were so many prophets, would
they have let them be burnt?</p>

<p>He says that Noah could as easily have restored in spirit
the book of Enoch, destroyed by the Deluge, as Esdras could
have restored the Scriptures lost during the Captivity.</p>

incredible that the Seventy may have explained the holy Scriptures
with that uniformity which we admire in them. And he

<p>Saint Hilary, in his preface to the Psalms, says that Esdras
arranged the Psalms in order.</p>

<p>The origin of this tradition comes from the 14th chapter of
the fourth book of Esdras. <i>Deus glorificatus est, et Scripturæ
vere divinæ creditæ sunt, omnibus eandem et eisdem verbis et
eisdem nominibus recitantibus ab initio usque ad finem, uti et
præsentes gentes cognoscerent quoniam per inspirationem Dei
interpretatæ sunt Scripturæ, et non esset mirabile Deum hoc in
eis operatum: quando in ea captivitate populi quæ facta est a
Nabuchodonosor, corruptis scripturis et post 70 annos Judæis
descendentibus in regionem suam, et post deinde temporibus
Artaxerxis Persarum regis, inspiravit Esdræ sacerdoti tribus
Levi præteritorum prophetarum omnes rememorare sermones, et
restituere populo eam legem quæ data est per Moysen.</i></p>

<p><i>Against the story in Esdras, 2 Maccab.</i> ii;—Josephus,
<i>Antiquities</i>, II, i—Cyrus took occasion from the prophecy of
Isaiah to release the people. The Jews held their property in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
peace under Cyrus in Babylon; hence they could well have
the Law.</p>

<p>Josephus, in the whole history of Esdras, does not say one
word about this restoration.—2 Kings xvii, 27.</p>

that the Scripture is Holy Scripture; for this story is based
only on the authority of those who assert that of the Seventy,
which shows that the Scripture is holy.</p>

<p>Therefore if this account be true, we have what we want
therein; if not, we have it elsewhere. And thus those who
would ruin the truth of our religion, founded on Moses, establish
it by the same authority by which they attack it. So by this
providence it still exists.</p>

<p><i>Prophecies.</i>—The sceptre was not interrupted by the captivity
in Babylon, because the return was promised and foretold.</p>


<h4><a name="p_637" id="p_637"></a>637</h4>

<p><i>Proofs of Jesus Christ.</i>—Captivity, with the assurance of
deliverance within seventy years, was not real captivity. But
now they are captives without any hope.</p>

<p>God has promised them that even though He should scatter
them to the ends of the earth, nevertheless if they were faithful
to His law, He would assemble them together again. They
are very faithful to it, and remain oppressed.</p>


<h4><a name="p_638" id="p_638"></a>638</h4>

<p>When Nebuchadnezzar carried away the people, for fear they
should believe that the sceptre had departed from Judah, they
were told beforehand that they would be there for a short time,
and that they would be restored. They were always consoled
by the prophets; and their kings continued. But the second
destruction is without promise of restoration, without prophets,
without kings, without consolation, without hope, because the
sceptre is taken away for ever.</p>


<h4><a name="p_639" id="p_639"></a>639</h4>

<p>It is a wonderful thing, and worthy of particular attention,
to see this Jewish people existing so many years in perpetual
misery, it being necessary as a proof of Jesus Christ, both that
they should exist to prove Him, and that they should be
miserable because they crucified Him; and though to be miserable
and to exist are contradictory, they nevertheless still exist
in spite of their misery.</p>


<h4><a name="p_640" id="p_640"></a>640</h4>

<p>They are visibly a people expressly created to serve as a
witness to the Messiah (Isaiah, xliii, 9; xliv, 8). They keep the
books, and love them, and do not understand them. And all
this was foretold; that God's judgments are entrusted to them,
but as a sealed book.</p>

<h3>TYPOLOGY</h3>


<h4><a name="p_641" id="p_641"></a>641</h4>

<p><i>Proof of the two Testaments at once.</i>—To prove the two at one
stroke, we need only see if the prophecies in one are fulfilled in
the other. To examine the prophecies, we must understand
them. For if we believe they have only one meaning, it is
certain that the Messiah has not come; but if they have two
meanings, it is certain that He has come in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The whole problem then is to know if they have two meanings.</p>

<p>That the Scripture has two meanings, which Jesus Christ and
the Apostles have given, is shown by the following proofs:</p>

<p>1. Proof by Scripture itself.</p>

<p>2. Proof by the Rabbis. Moses Maimonides says that it has
two aspects, and that the prophets have prophesied Jesus Christ
only.</p>

<p>3. Proof by the Kabbala.<a name="FNanchor_234_238" id="FNanchor_234_238"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_234_238" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>4. Proof by the mystical interpretation which the Rabbis
themselves give to Scripture.</p>

<p>5. Proof by the principles of the Rabbis, that there are two
meanings; that there are two advents of the Messiah, a glorious
and an humiliating one, according to their desert; that the
prophets have prophesied of the Messiah only—the Law is not
eternal, but must change at the coming of the Messiah—that
then they shall no more remember the Red Sea; that the Jews
and the Gentiles shall be mingled.</p>

<p>[6. Proof by the key which Jesus Christ and the Apostles
give us.]</p>


<h4><a name="p_642" id="p_642"></a>642</h4>

<p>Isaiah, li. The Red Sea an image of the Redemption. <i>Ut
sciatis quod filius hominis habet potestatem remittendi peccata,
tibi dico: Surge.</i><a name="FNanchor_235_239" id="FNanchor_235_239"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_235_239" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> God, wishing to show that He could form a
people holy with an invisible holiness, and fill them with an
eternal glory, made visible things. As nature is an image of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
grace, He has done in the bounties of nature what He would
do in those of grace, in order that we might judge that He could
make the invisible, since He made the visible excellently.</p>

<p>Therefore He saved this people from the deluge; He has
raised them up from Abraham, redeemed them from their
enemies, and set them at rest.</p>

<p>The object of God was not to save them from the deluge, and
raise up a whole people from Abraham, only in order to bring
them into a rich land.</p>

<p>And even grace is only the type of glory, for it is not the
ultimate end. It has been symbolised by the law, and itself
symbolises [<i>glory</i>]. But it is the type of it, and the origin or
cause.</p>

<p>The ordinary life of men is like that of the saints. They
all seek their satisfaction, and differ only in the object in which
they place it; they call those their enemies who hinder them, etc.
God has then shown the power which He has of giving invisible
blessings, by that which He has shown Himself to have over
things visible.</p>


<h4><a name="p_643" id="p_643"></a>643</h4>

<p><i>Types.</i>—God, wishing to form for Himself an holy people,
whom He should separate from all other nations, whom He
should deliver from their enemies, and should put into a place of
rest, has promised to do so, and has foretold by His prophets the
time and the manner of His coming. And yet, to confirm the
hope of His elect, He has made them see in it an image through
all time, without leaving them devoid of assurances of His power
and of His will to save them. For, at the creation of man,
Adam was the witness, and guardian of the promise of a Saviour,
who should be born of woman, when men were still so near the
creation that they could not have forgotten their creation and
their fall. When those who had seen Adam were no longer in
the world, God sent Noah whom He saved, and drowned the
whole earth by a miracle which sufficiently indicated the power
which He had to save the world, and the will which He had to
do so, and to raise up from the seed of woman Him whom He
had promised. This miracle was enough to confirm the hope
of men.</p>

<p>The memory of the deluge being so fresh among men, while
Noah was still alive, God made promises to Abraham, and,
while Shem was still living, sent Moses, etc....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_644" id="p_644"></a>644</h4>

<p><i>Types.</i>—God, willing to deprive His own of perishable
blessings, created the Jewish people in order to show that this
was not owing to lack of power.</p>


<h4><a name="p_645" id="p_645"></a>645</h4>

<p>The Synagogue did not perish, because it was a type. But
because it was only a type, it fell into servitude. The type
existed till the truth came, in order that the Church should
be always visible, either in the sign which promised it, or in
substance.</p>


<h4><a name="p_646" id="p_646"></a>646</h4>

<p>That the law was figurative.</p>


<h4><a name="p_647" id="p_647"></a>647</h4>

<p>Two errors: 1. To take everything literally. 2. To take
everything spiritually.</p>


<h4><a name="p_648" id="p_648"></a>648</h4>

<p>To speak against too greatly figurative language.</p>


<h4><a name="p_649" id="p_649"></a>649</h4>

<p>There are some types clear and demonstrative, but others
which seem somewhat far-fetched, and which convince only
those who are already persuaded. These are like the Apocalyptics.
But the difference is that they have none which are
certain, so that nothing is so unjust as to claim that theirs are
as well founded as some of ours; for they have none so demonstrative
as some of ours. The comparison is unfair. We must
not put on the same level, and confound things, because they
seem to agree in one point, while they are so different in another.
The clearness in divine things requires us to revere the obscurities
in them.</p>

<p>[It is like men, who employ a certain obscure language among
themselves. Those who should not understand it, would
understand only a foolish meaning.]</p>


<h4><a name="p_650" id="p_650"></a>650</h4>

<p><i>Extravagances of the Apocalyptics, Preadamites, Millenarians,
etc.</i>—He who would base extravagant opinions on Scripture, will,
for example, base them on this. It is said that "this generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled."<a name="FNanchor_236_240" id="FNanchor_236_240"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_236_240" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Upon that I
will say that after that generation will come another generation,
and so on ever in succession.</p>

<p>Solomon and the King are spoken of in the second book of
Chronicles, as if they were two different persons. I will say
that they were two.</p>


<h4><a name="p_651" id="p_651"></a>651</h4>

<p><i>Particular Types.</i>—A double law, double tables of the law,

<p>In God the word does not differ from the intention, for He is
true; nor the word from the effect, for He is powerful; nor the
means from the effect, for He is wise. Bern., <i>Ult. Sermo in

<p>Augustine, <i>De Civit. Dei</i>, v, 10. This rule is general. God
can do everything, except those things, which if He could do,
He would not be almighty, as dying, being deceived, lying, etc.</p>

<p>Several Evangelists for the confirmation of the truth; their
difference useful.</p>

<p>The Eucharist after the Lord's Supper. Truth after the type.</p>

<p>The ruin of Jerusalem, a type of the ruin of the world, forty
years after the death of Jesus. "I know not," as a man, or as

for the formation of Adam, are only the picture of the six ages
to form Jesus Christ and the Church. If Adam had not sinned,
and Jesus Christ had not come, there had been only one covenant,
only one age of men, and the creation would have been represented
as accomplished at one single time.</p>


<h4><a name="p_656" id="p_656"></a>656</h4>

<p><i>Types.</i>—The Jewish and Egyptian peoples were plainly
foretold by the two individuals whom Moses met; the Egyptian
beating the Jew, Moses avenging him and killing the Egyptian,
and the Jew being ungrateful.</p>


<h4><a name="p_657" id="p_657"></a>657</h4>

<p>The symbols of the Gospel for the state of the sick soul are
sick bodies; but because one body cannot be sick enough to
express it well, several have been needed. Thus there are the
deaf, the dumb, the blind, the paralytic, the dead Lazarus, the
possessed. All this crowd is in the sick soul.</p>


<h4><a name="p_658" id="p_658"></a>658</h4>

<p><i>Types.</i>—To show that the Old Testament is only figurative,
and that the prophets understood by temporal blessings other
blessings, this is the proof:</p>

<p>First, that this would be unworthy of God.</p>

<p>Secondly, that their discourses express very clearly the
promise of temporal blessings, and that they say nevertheless
that their discourses are obscure, and that their meaning will
not be understood. Whence it appears that this secret meaning
was not that which they openly expressed, and that consequently
they meant to speak of other sacrifices, of another deliverer, etc.
They say that they will be understood only in the fullness of time
(Jer. xxx, <i>ult.</i>).</p>

<p>The third proof is that their discourses are contradictory, and
neutralise each other; so that if we think that they did not
mean by the words "law" and "sacrifice" anything else than
that of Moses, there is a plain and gross contradiction. Therefore
they meant something else, sometimes contradicting themselves
in the same chapter. Now, to understand the meaning
of an author ...</p>


<h4><a name="p_659" id="p_659"></a>659</h4>

<p>Lust has become natural to us, and has made our second
nature. Thus there are two natures in us—the one good, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
other bad. Where is God? Where you are not, and the kingdom
of God is within you. The Rabbis.</p>


<h4><a name="p_660" id="p_660"></a>660</h4>

<p>Penitence, alone of all these mysteries, has been manifestly
declared to the Jews, and by Saint John, the Forerunner; and
then the other mysteries; to indicate that in each man, as in
the entire world, this order must be observed.</p>


<h4><a name="p_661" id="p_661"></a>661</h4>

<p>The carnal Jews understood neither the greatness nor the
humiliation of the Messiah foretold in their prophecies. They
misunderstood Him in His foretold greatness, as when He said
that the Messiah should be lord of David, though his son, and
that He was before Abraham, who had seen Him. They did not
believe Him so great as to be eternal, and they likewise misunderstood
Him in His humiliation and in His death. "The
Messiah," said they, "abideth for ever, and this man says that
he shall die."<a name="FNanchor_240_244" id="FNanchor_240_244"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_240_244" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> Therefore they believed Him neither mortal
nor eternal; they only sought in Him for a carnal greatness.</p>


<h4><a name="p_662" id="p_662"></a>662</h4>

<p><i>Typical.</i>—Nothing is so like charity as covetousness, and
nothing is so opposed to it. Thus the Jews, full of possessions
which flattered their covetousness, were very like Christians, and
very contrary. And by this means they had the two qualities
which it was necessary they should have, to be very like the
Messiah to typify Him, and very contrary not to be suspected
witnesses.</p>


<h4><a name="p_663" id="p_663"></a>663</h4>

<p><i>Typical.</i>—God made use of the lust of the Jews to make them
minister to Jesus Christ, [who brought the remedy for their lust].</p>


<h4><a name="p_664" id="p_664"></a>664</h4>

<p>Charity is not a figurative precept. It is dreadful to say that
Jesus Christ, who came to take away types in order to establish
the truth, came only to establish the type of charity, in order
to take away the existing reality which was there before.</p>

<h4><a name="p_667" id="p_667"></a>667</h4>

<p>We are estranged, only by departing from charity. Our
prayers and our virtues are abominable before God, if they are
not the prayers and the virtues of Jesus Christ. And our sins
will never be the object of [<i>mercy</i>], but of the justice of God,
if they are not [<i>those of</i>] Jesus Christ. He has adopted our sins,
and has [<i>admitted</i>] us into union [<i>with Him</i>], for virtues are
[<i>His own, and</i>] sins are foreign to Him; while virtues <i>[are]</i>
foreign to us, and our sins are our own.</p>

<p>Let us change the rule which we have hitherto chosen for
judging what is good. We had our own will as our rule. Let
us now take the will of [<i>God</i>]; all that He wills is good and right
to us, all that He does not will is [<i>bad</i>].</p>

<p>All that God does not permit is forbidden. Sins are forbidden
by the general declaration that God has made, that He
did not allow them. Other things which He has left without
general prohibition, and which for that reason are said to be
permitted, are nevertheless not always permitted. For when
God removed some one of them from us, and when, by the event,
which is a manifestation of the will of God, it appears that God
does not will that we should have a thing, that is then forbidden
to us as sin; since the will of God is that we should not have one
more than another. There is this sole difference between these
two things, that it is certain that God will never allow sin, while
it is not certain that He will never allow the other. But so long
as God does not permit it, we ought to regard it as sin; so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
as the absence of God's will, which alone is all goodness and all
justice, renders it unjust and wrong.</p>


<h4><a name="p_668" id="p_668"></a>668</h4>

<p>To change the type, because of our weakness.</p>


<h4><a name="p_669" id="p_669"></a>669</h4>

<p><i>Types.</i>—The Jews had grown old in these earthly thoughts,
that God loved their father Abraham, his flesh and what sprung
from it; that on account of this He had multiplied them, and
distinguished them from all other nations, without allowing
them to intermingle; that when they were languishing in Egypt,
He brought them out with all these great signs in their favour;
that He fed them with manna in the desert, and led them into
a very rich land; that He gave them kings and a well-built
temple, in order to offer up beasts before Him, by the shedding
of whose blood they should be purified; and that at last He was
to send them the Messiah to make them masters of all the world,
and foretold the time of His coming.</p>

<p>The world having grown old in these carnal errors, Jesus
Christ came at the time foretold, but not with the expected
glory; and thus men did not think it was He. After His death,
Saint Paul<a name="FNanchor_248_252" id="FNanchor_248_252"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_248_252" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> came to teach men that all these things had happened
in allegory; that the kingdom of God did not consist in the
flesh, but in the spirit; that the enemies of men were not the
Babylonians, but the passions; that God delighted not in temples
made with hands, but in a pure and contrite heart; that the
circumcision of the body was unprofitable, but that of the
heart was needed; that Moses had not given them the bread
from heaven, etc.<a name="FNanchor_249_253" id="FNanchor_249_253"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_249_253" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>But God, not having desired to reveal these things to this
people who were unworthy of them, and having nevertheless
desired to foretell them, in order that they might be believed,
foretold the time clearly, and expressed the things sometimes
clearly, but very often in figures, in order that those who loved
symbols might consider them, and those who loved what was
symbolised might see it therein.</p>

<p>All that tends not to charity is figurative.</p>

<p>The sole aim of the Scripture is charity.</p>

<p>All which tends not to the sole end is the type of it. For
since there is only one end, all which does not lead to it in
express terms is figurative.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>God thus varies that sole precept of charity to satisfy our
curiosity, which seeks for variety, by that variety which still
leads us to the one thing needful. For one thing alone is needful,<a name="FNanchor_250_254" id="FNanchor_250_254"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_250_254" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
and we love variety; and God satisfies both by these varieties,
which lead to the one thing needful.</p>

<p>The Jews have so much loved the shadows, and have so strictly
expected them, that they have misunderstood the reality, when it
came in the time and manner foretold.</p>

<p>The Rabbis take the breasts of the Spouse<a name="FNanchor_251_255" id="FNanchor_251_255"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_251_255" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> for types, and all
that does not express the only end they have, namely, temporal
good.</p>

<p>And Christians take even the Eucharist as a type of the glory
at which they aim.</p>


<h4><a name="p_670" id="p_670"></a>670</h4>

<p>The Jews, who have been called to subdue nations and kings,
have been the slaves of sin; and the Christians, whose calling
has been to be servants and subjects, are free children.<a name="FNanchor_252_256" id="FNanchor_252_256"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_252_256" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>


<h4><a name="p_671" id="p_671"></a>671</h4>

<p><i>A formal point.</i>—When Saint Peter and the Apostles
deliberated about abolishing circumcision, where it was a
question of acting against the law of God, they did not heed the
prophets, but simply the reception of the Holy Spirit in the
persons uncircumcised.<a name="FNanchor_253_257" id="FNanchor_253_257"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_253_257" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>They thought it more certain that God approved of those
whom He filled with His Spirit, than it was that the law must be
obeyed. They knew that the end of the law was only the
Holy Spirit; and that thus, as men certainly had this without
circumcision, it was not necessary.</p>


<h4><a name="p_672" id="p_672"></a>672</h4>

<p><i>Fac secundum exemplar quod tibi ostensum est in monte.</i><a name="FNanchor_254_258" id="FNanchor_254_258"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_254_258" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>—
The Jewish religion then has been formed on its likeness to the
truth of the Messiah; and the truth of the Messiah has been
recognised by the Jewish religion, which was the type of it.</p>

<p>Among the Jews the truth was only typified; in heaven it
is revealed.</p>

<p>In the Church it is hidden, and recognised by its resemblance
to the type.</p>

<p>The type has been made according to the truth, and the
truth has been recognised according to the type.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>Saint Paul<a name="FNanchor_255_259" id="FNanchor_255_259"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_255_259" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> says himself that people will forbid to marry, and
he himself speaks of it to the Corinthians in a way which is a
snare. For if a prophet had said the one, and Saint Paul had
then said the other, he would have been accused.</p>


<h4><a name="p_673" id="p_673"></a>673</h4>

<p><i>Typical.</i>—"Do all things according to the pattern which
has been shown thee on the mount." On which Saint Paul
says that the Jews have shadowed forth heavenly things.<a name="FNanchor_256_260" id="FNanchor_256_260"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_256_260" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>


<h4><a name="p_674" id="p_674"></a>674</h4>

<p>... And yet this Covenant, made to blind some and enlighten
others, indicated in those very persons, whom it blinded, the
truth which should be recognised by others. For the visible
blessings which they received from God were so great and so
divine, that He indeed appeared able to give them those that
are invisible, and a Messiah.</p>

<p>For nature is an image of Grace, and visible miracles are
images of the invisible. <i>Ut sciatis ... tibi dico: Surge.</i></p>

<p>Isaiah says that Redemption will be as the passage of the
Red Sea.</p>

<p>God has then shown by the deliverance from Egypt, and
from the sea, by the defeat of kings, by the manna, by the
whole genealogy of Abraham, that He was able to save, to
send down bread from heaven, etc.; so that the people hostile
to Him are the type and the representation of the very Messiah
whom they know not, etc.</p>

<p>He has then taught us at last that all these things were only
types, and what is "true freedom," a "true Israelite," "true
circumcision," "true bread from heaven," etc.</p>

<p>In these promises each one finds what he has most at heart,
temporal benefits or spiritual, God or the creatures; but with
this difference, that those who therein seek the creatures find
them, but with many contradictions, with a prohibition against
loving them, with the command to worship God only, and to
love Him only, which is the same thing, and, finally, that the
Messiah came not for them; whereas those who therein seek God
find Him, without any contradiction, with the command to love
Him only, and that the Messiah came in the time foretold, to
give them the blessings which they ask.</p>

<p>Thus the Jews had miracles and prophecies, which they
say fulfilled and the teaching of their law was to worship and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
love God only; it was also perpetual. Thus it had all the marks
of the true religion; and so it was. But the Jewish teaching
must be distinguished from the teaching of the Jewish law.
Now the Jewish teaching was not true, although it had miracles
and prophecy and perpetuity, because it had not this other
point of worshipping and loving God only.</p>


<h4><a name="p_675" id="p_675"></a>675</h4>

<p>The veil, which is upon these books for the Jews, is there also
for evil Christians, and for all who do not hate themselves.</p>

<p>But how well disposed men are to understand them and to
know Jesus Christ, when they truly hate themselves!</p>


<h4><a name="p_676" id="p_676"></a>676</h4>

<p>A type conveys absence and presence, pleasure and pain.</p>

<p>A cipher has a double meaning, one clear, and one in which
it is said that the meaning is hidden.</p>


<h4><a name="p_677" id="p_677"></a>677</h4>

<p><i>Types.</i>—A portrait conveys absence and presence, pleasure
and pain. The reality excludes absence and pain.</p>

<p>To know if the law and the sacrifices are a reality or a type,
we must see if the prophets, in speaking of these things, confined
their view and their thought to them, so that they saw
only the old covenant; or if they saw therein something else
of which they were the representation, for in a portrait we see
the thing figured. For this we need only examine what they
say of them.</p>

<p>When they say that it will be eternal, do they mean to speak
of that covenant which they say will be changed; and so of the
sacrifices, etc.?</p>

<p>A cipher has two meanings. When we find out an important
letter in which we discover a clear meaning, and in which it is
nevertheless said that the meaning is veiled and obscure, that
it is hidden, so that we might read the letter without seeing it,
and interpret it without understanding it, what must we think
but that here is a cipher with a double meaning, and the more
so if we find obvious contradictions in the literal meaning? The
prophets have clearly said that Israel would be always loved by
God, and that the law would be eternal; and they have said that
their meaning would not be understood, and that it was veiled.</p>

<p>How greatly then ought we to value those who interpret the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
cipher, and teach us to understand the hidden meaning, especially
if the principles which they educe are perfectly clear and natural!
This is what Jesus Christ did, and the Apostles. They broke
the seal; He rent the veil, and revealed the spirit. They have
taught us through this that the enemies of man are his passions;
that the Redeemer would be spiritual, and His reign spiritual;
that there would be two advents, one in lowliness to humble
the proud, the other in glory to exalt the humble; that Jesus
Christ would be both God and man.</p>


<h4><a name="p_678" id="p_678"></a>678</h4>

<p><i>Types.</i>—Jesus Christ opened their mind to understand the
Scriptures.</p>

<p>Two great revelations are these. (1) All things happened
to them in types: <i>vere Israëlitæ, vere liberi</i>, true bread from
Heaven. (2) A God humbled to the Cross. It was necessary
that Christ should suffer in order to enter into glory, "that He
should destroy death through death."<a name="FNanchor_257_261" id="FNanchor_257_261"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_257_261" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Two advents.</p>


<h4><a name="p_679" id="p_679"></a>679</h4>

<p><i>Types.</i>—When once this secret is disclosed, it is impossible not
to see it. Let us read the Old Testament in this light, and let
us see if the sacrifices were real; if the fatherhood of Abraham
was the true cause of the friendship of God; and if the promised
land was the true place of rest. No. They are therefore types.
Let us in the same way examine all those ordained ceremonies,
all those commandments which are not of charity, and we shall
see that they are types.</p>

<p>All these sacrifices and ceremonies were then either types or
nonsense. Now these are things too clear, and too lofty, to be
thought nonsense.</p>

<p>To know if the prophets confined their view in the Old
Testament, or saw therein other things.</p>

<p><i>Types</i>,—The letter kills. All happened in types. Here is
the cipher which Saint Paul gives us. Christ must suffer. An
humiliated God. Circumcision of the heart, true fasting, true
sacrifice, a true temple. The prophets have shown that all
these must be spiritual.</p>

<p>Not the meat which perishes, but that which does not perish.</p>

<p>"Ye shall be free indeed."<a name="FNanchor_260_264" id="FNanchor_260_264"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_260_264" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Then the other freedom was only

<h4><a name="p_683" id="p_683"></a>683</h4>

<p><i>Contradiction.</i>—We can only describe a good character by
reconciling all contrary qualities, and it is not enough to keep
up a series of harmonious qualities, without reconciling contradictory
ones. To understand the meaning of an author, we must
make all the contrary passages agree.</p>

<p>Thus, to understand Scripture, we must have a meaning in
which all the contrary passages are reconciled. It is not enough
to have one which suits many concurring passages; but it is
necessary to have one which reconciles even contradictory
passages.</p>

<p>Every author has a meaning in which all the contradictory
passages agree, or he has no meaning at all. We cannot affirm
the latter of Scripture and the prophets; they undoubtedly are
full of good sense. We must then seek for a meaning which
reconciles all discrepancies.</p>

<p>The true meaning then is not that of the Jews; but in Jesus
Christ all the contradictions are reconciled.</p>

<p>The Jews could not reconcile the cessation of the royalty and
principality, foretold by Hosea, with the prophecy of Jacob.</p>

<p>If we take the law, the sacrifices, and the kingdom as realities,
we cannot reconcile all the passages. They must then necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
be only types. We cannot even reconcile the passages of the
same author, nor of the same book, nor sometimes of the same
chapter, which indicates copiously what was the meaning of
the author. As when Ezekiel, chap, xx, says that man will
not live by the commandments of God and will live by them.</p>


<h4><a name="p_684" id="p_684"></a>684</h4>

<p><i>Types.</i>—If the law and the sacrifices are the truth, it must
please God, and must not displease Him. If they are types,
they must be both pleasing and displeasing.</p>

<p>Now in all the Scripture they are both pleasing and displeasing.
It is said that the law shall be changed; that the sacrifice shall
be changed; that they shall be without law, without a prince,
and without a sacrifice; that a new covenant shall be made;
that the law shall be renewed; that the precepts which they have
received are not good; that their sacrifices are abominable;
that God has demanded none of them.</p>

<p>It is said, on the contrary, that the law shall abide for ever;
that this covenant shall be for ever; that sacrifice shall be eternal;
that the sceptre shall never depart from among them, because it
shall not depart from them till the eternal King comes.</p>

<p>Do all these passages indicate what is real? No. Do they
then indicate what is typical? No, but what is either real or
typical. But the first passages, excluding as they do reality,
indicate that all this is only typical.</p>

<p>All these passages together cannot be applied to reality; all
can be said to be typical; therefore they are not spoken of reality,
but of the type.</p>

<p><i>Agnus occisus est ab origine mundi.</i><a name="FNanchor_262_266" id="FNanchor_262_266"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_262_266" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> A sacrificing judge.</p>


<h4><a name="p_685" id="p_685"></a>685</h4>

<p><i>Contradictions.</i>—The sceptre till the Messiah—without king
or prince.</p>

<p>The eternal law—changed.</p>

<p>The eternal covenant—a new covenant.</p>

<p>Good laws—bad precepts. Ezekiel.</p>


<h4><a name="p_686" id="p_686"></a>686</h4>

<p><i>Types.</i>—When the word of God, which is really true, is false
literally, it is true spiritually. <i>Sede a dextris meis:</i><a name="FNanchor_263_267" id="FNanchor_263_267"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_263_267" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> this is false
literally, therefore it is true spiritually.</p>

<p>In these expressions, God is spoken of after the manner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
men; and this means nothing else but that the intention which
men have in giving a seat at their right hand, God will have also.
It is then an indication of the intention of God, not of His manner
of carrying it out.</p>

<p>Thus when it is said, "God has received the odour of your
incense, and will in recompense give you a rich land," that is
equivalent to saying that the same intention which a man
would have, who, pleased with your perfumes, should in recompense
give you a rich land, God will have towards you, because
you have had the same intention as a man has towards him
to whom he presents perfumes. So <i>iratus est</i>, a "jealous
God,"<a name="FNanchor_264_268" id="FNanchor_264_268"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_264_268" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> etc. For, the things of God being inexpressible, they
cannot be spoken of otherwise, and the Church makes use of
them even to-day: <i>Quia confortavil seras</i>,<a name="FNanchor_265_269" id="FNanchor_265_269"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_265_269" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> etc.</p>

<p>It is not allowable to attribute to Scripture the meaning
which is not revealed to us that it has. Thus, to say that the
closed <i>mem</i><a name="FNanchor_266_270" id="FNanchor_266_270"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_266_270" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> of Isaiah signifies six hundred, has not been revealed.
It might be said that the final <i>tsade</i> and <i>he deficientes</i> may
signify mysteries. But it is not allowable to say so, and still
less to say this is the way of the philosopher's stone. But we
say that the literal meaning is not the true meaning, because
the prophets have themselves said so.</p>


<h4><a name="p_687" id="p_687"></a>687</h4>

<p>I do not say that the <i>mem</i> is mystical.</p>


<h4><a name="p_688" id="p_688"></a>688</h4>

<p>Moses (Deut. xxx) promises that God will circumcise their
heart to render them capable of loving Him.</p>


<h4><a name="p_689" id="p_689"></a>689</h4>

<p>One saying of David, or of Moses, as for instance that "God
will circumcise the heart," enables us to judge of their spirit.
If all their other expressions were ambiguous, and left us in
doubt whether they were philosophers or Christians, one saying
of this kind would in fact determine all the rest, as one sentence
of Epictetus decides the meaning of all the rest to be the opposite.
So far ambiguity exists, but not afterwards.</p>


<h4><a name="p_690" id="p_690"></a>690</h4>

<p>If one of two persons, who are telling silly stories, uses language
with a double meaning, understood in his own circle, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
other uses it with only one meaning, any one not in the secret,
who hears them both talk in this manner, will pass upon them
the same judgment. But if afterwards, in the rest of their conversation
one says angelic things, and the other always dull
commonplaces, he will judge that the one spoke in mysteries,
and not the other; the one having sufficiently shown that he is
incapable of such foolishness, and capable of being mysterious;
and the other that he is incapable of mystery, and capable of
foolishness.</p>

<p>The Old Testament is a cipher.</p>


<h4><a name="p_691" id="p_691"></a>691</h4>

<p>There are some that see clearly that man has no other enemy
than lust, which turns him from God, and not God; and that he
has no other good than God, and not a rich land. Let those who
believe that the good of man is in the flesh, and evil in what
turns him away from sensual pleasures, [<i>satiate</i>] themselves
with them, and [<i>die</i>] in them. But let those who seek God
with all their heart, who are only troubled at not seeing Him,
who desire only to possess Him, and have as enemies only
those who turn them away from Him, who are grieved at seeing
themselves surrounded and overwhelmed with such enemies,
take comfort. I proclaim to them happy news. There exists
a Redeemer for them. I shall show Him to them. I shall
show that there is a God for them. I shall not show Him to
others. I shall make them see that a Messiah has been promised,
who should deliver them from their enemies, and that One has
come to free them from their iniquities, but not from their
enemies.</p>

<p>When David foretold that the Messiah would deliver His
people from their enemies, one can believe that in the flesh these
would be the Egyptians; and then I cannot show that the
prophecy was fulfilled. But one can well believe also that the
enemies would be their sins; for indeed the Egyptians were not
their enemies, but their sins were so. This word, enemies, is
therefore ambiguous. But if he says elsewhere, as he does,
that He will deliver His people from their sins, as indeed do
Isaiah and others, the ambiguity is removed, and the double
meaning of enemies is reduced to the simple meaning of iniquities.
For if he had sins in his mind, he could well denote them as
enemies; but if he thought of enemies, he could not designate
them as iniquities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Moses, David, and Isaiah used the same terms. Who
will say then that they have not the same meaning, and that
David's meaning, which is plainly iniquities when he spoke of
enemies, was not the same as [<i>that of</i>] Moses when speaking
of enemies?</p>

<p>Daniel (ix) prays for the deliverance of the people from the
captivity of their enemies. But he was thinking of sins, and,
to show this, he says that Gabriel came to tell him that his prayer
was heard, and that there were only seventy weeks to wait, after
which the people would be freed from iniquity, sin would have
an end, and the Redeemer, the Holy of Holies, would bring
<i>eternal</i> justice, not legal, but eternal.</p>

<h3>THE PROPHECIES</h3>


<h4><a name="p_692" id="p_692"></a>692</h4>

<p>When I see the blindness and the wretchedness of man, when
I regard the whole silent universe, and man without light, left
to himself, and, as it were, lost in this corner of the universe,
without knowing who has put him there, what he has come to
do, what will become of him at death, and incapable of all
knowledge, I become terrified, like a man who should be carried
in his sleep to a dreadful desert island, and should awake without
knowing where he is, and without means of escape. And
thereupon I wonder how people in a condition so wretched do
not fall into despair. I see other persons around me of a like
nature. I ask them if they are better informed than I am.
They tell me that they are not. And thereupon these wretched
and lost beings, having looked around them, and seen some
pleasing objects, have given and attached themselves to them.
For my own part, I have not been able to attach myself to them,
and, considering how strongly it appears that there is something
else than what I see, I have examined whether this God has not
left some sign of Himself.</p>

<p>I see many contradictory religions, and consequently all false
save one. Each wants to be believed on its own authority, and
threatens unbelievers. I do not therefore believe them. Every
one can say this; every one can call himself a prophet. But I
see that Christian religion wherein prophecies are fulfilled; and
that is what every one cannot do.</p>

<h4><a name="p_704" id="p_704"></a>704</h4>

<p><i>Proof.</i>—Prophecies with their fulfilment; what has preceded
and what has followed Jesus Christ.</p>


<h4><a name="p_705" id="p_705"></a>705</h4>

<p>The prophecies are the strongest proof of Jesus Christ. It
is for them also that God has made most provision; for the event
which has fulfilled them is a miracle existing since the birth of
the Church to the end. So God has raised up prophets during
sixteen hundred years, and, during four hundred years afterwards,
He has scattered all these prophecies among all the Jews,
who carried them into all parts of the world. Such was the
preparation for the birth of Jesus Christ, and, as His Gospel
was to be believed by all the world, it was not only necessary
that there should be prophecies to make it believed, but that
these prophecies should exist throughout the whole world, in
order to make it embraced by the whole world.</p>


<h4><a name="p_706" id="p_706"></a>706</h4>

<p>But it was not enough that the prophecies should exist. It
was necessary that they should be distributed throughout all
places, and preserved throughout all times. And in order that
this agreement might not be taken for an effect of chance, it was
necessary that this should be foretold.</p>

<p>It is far more glorious for the Messiah that the Jews should
be the spectators, and even the instruments of His glory, besides
that God had reserved them.</p>

<h4><a name="p_708" id="p_708"></a>708</h4>

<p>One must be bold to predict the same thing in so many ways.
It was necessary that the four idolatrous or pagan monarchies,
the end of the kingdom of Judah, and the seventy weeks, should
happen at the same time, and all this before the second temple
was destroyed.</p>


<h4><a name="p_709" id="p_709"></a>709</h4>

<p><i>Prophecies.</i>—If one man alone had made a book of predictions
about Jesus Christ, as to the time and the manner, and Jesus
Christ had come in conformity to these prophecies, this fact
would have infinite weight.</p>

<p>But there is much more here. Here is a succession of men
during four thousand years, who, consequently and without
variation, come, one after another, to foretell this same event.
Here is a whole people who announce it, and who have existed
for four thousand years, in order to give corporate testimony
of the assurances which they have, and from which they cannot
be diverted by whatever threats and persecutions people may
make against them. This is far more important.</p>


<h4><a name="p_710" id="p_710"></a>710</h4>

<p><i>Predictions of particular things.</i>—They were strangers in
Egypt, without any private property, either in that country or
elsewhere. [There was not the least appearance, either of the
royalty which had previously existed so long, or of that supreme
council of seventy judges which they called the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, and
which, having been instituted by Moses, lasted to the time of
Jesus Christ. All these things were as far removed from their
state at that time as they could be], when Jacob, dying, and
blessing his twelve children, declared to them, that they would
be proprietors of a great land, and foretold in particular to the
family of Judah, that the kings, who would one day rule them,
should be of his race; and that all his brethren should be their
subjects; [and that even the Messiah, who was to be the
expectation of nations, should spring from him; and that the
kingship should not be taken away from Judah, nor the ruler
and law-giver of his descendants, till the expected Messiah
should arrive in his family].</p>

<p>This same Jacob, disposing of this future land as though he
had been its ruler, gave a portion to Joseph more than to the
others. "I give you," said he, "one part more than to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
brothers." And blessing his two children, Ephraim and
Manasseh, whom Joseph had presented to him, the elder,
Manasseh, on his right, and the young Ephraim on his left, he
put his arms crosswise, and placing his right hand on the head
of Ephraim, and his left on Manasseh, he blessed them in this
manner. And, upon Joseph's representing to him that he was
preferring the younger, he replied to him with admirable resolution:
"I know it well, my son; but Ephraim will increase more
than Manasseh." This has been indeed so true in the result,
that, being alone almost as fruitful as the two entire lines which
composed a whole kingdom, they have been usually called by the
name of Ephraim alone.</p>

<p>This same Joseph, when dying, bade his children carry his
bones with them when they should go into that land, to which
they only came two hundred years afterwards.</p>

<p>Moses, who wrote all these things so long before they happened,
himself assigned to each family portions of that land before they
entered it, as though he had been its ruler. [In fact he declared
that God was to raise up from their nation and their race a
prophet, of whom he was the type; and he foretold them exactly
all that was to happen to them in the land which they were to
enter after his death, the victories which God would give them,
their ingratitude towards God, the punishments which they
would receive for it, and the rest of their adventures.] He
gave them judges who should make the division. He prescribed
the entire form of political government which they
should observe, the cities of refuge which they should build,
and ...</p>

<p><i>Perpetual captivity of the Jews.</i>—Jer. xi, 11: "I will bring
evil upon Judah from which they shall not be able to escape."</p>

<p><i>Types.</i>—Is. v: "The Lord had a vineyard, from which He
looked for grapes; and it brought forth only wild grapes. I
will therefore lay it waste, and destroy it; the earth shall only
bring forth thorns, and I will forbid the clouds from <i>[raining]</i>
upon it. The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the men of Judah His pleasant plant. I looked that they should
do justice, and they bring forth only iniquities."</p>

<p>Is. viii: "Sanctify the Lord with fear and trembling; let
Him be your only dread, and He shall be to you for a sanctuary,
but for a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence to both the
houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of
Jerusalem; and many among them shall stumble against that
stone, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and perish. Hide
my words, and cover my law for my disciples.</p>

<p>"I will then wait in patience upon the Lord that hideth and
concealeth Himself from the house of Jacob."</p>

<p>Is. xxix: "Be amazed and wonder, people of Israel; stagger
and stumble, and be drunken, but not with wine; stagger, but
not with strong drink. For the Lord hath poured out upon
you the spirit of deep sleep. He will close your eyes; He will
cover your princes and your prophets that have visions."
(Daniel xii: "The wicked shall not understand, but the wise
shall understand." Hosea, the last chapter, the last verse,
after many temporal blessings, says: "Who is wise, and he shall
understand these things, etc.?") "And the visions of all the
prophets are become unto you as a sealed book, which men
deliver to one that is learned, and who can read; and he saith,
I cannot read it, for it is sealed. And when the book is delivered
to them that are not learned, they say I am not learned.</p>

<p>"Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people with
their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from
me,"—there is the reason and the cause of it; for if they adored
God in their hearts, they would understand the prophecies,—
"and their fear towards me is taught by the precept of man.
Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among
this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; for the
wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and their understanding
shall be [hid]."</p>

come.</p>

<p>"By this we shall know that ye are gods. Yea, do good or
do evil, if you can. Let us then behold it and reason together.
Behold, ye are of nothing, and only an abomination, etc.
Who," (among contemporary writers), "hath declared from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
beginning that we may know of the things done from the
beginning and origin? that we may say, You are righteous.
There is none that teacheth us, yea, there is none that
declareth the future."</p>

another. I have foretold the things which have come to pass,
and things that are to come do I declare. Sing unto God a new
song in all the earth.</p>

<p>"Bring forth the blind people that have eyes and see not,
and the deaf that have ears and hear not. Let all the nations
be gathered together. Who among them can declare this, and
shew us former things, and things to come? Let them bring
forth their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them
hear, and say, It is truth.</p>

<p>Is. xlii: "Behold, the former things are come to pass, and
new things do I declare; before they spring forth I tell you of

<p>Is. xlviii, 3: "I have declared the former things from the
beginning; I did them suddenly; and they came to pass. Because
I know that thou art obstinate, that thy spirit is rebellious, and
thy brow brass; I have even declared it to thee before it came to
pass: lest thou shouldst say that it was the work of thy gods,
and the effect of their commands.</p>

<p>"Thou hast seen all this; and will not ye declare it? I have
shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things,
and thou didst not know them. They are created now, and not
from the beginning; I have kept them hidden from thee; lest
thou shouldst say, Behold, I knew them.</p>

that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou
couldst deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor

<p>"I have spread out my hands all the day unto an unbelieving
people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their
own thoughts; a people that provoketh me to anger continually
by the sins they commit in my face; that sacrificeth to idols, etc.</p>

<p>"These shall be scattered like smoke in the day of my
wrath, etc.</p>

<p>"Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers, will I
assemble together, and will recompense you for all according
to your works.</p>

<p>"Thus saith the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster,
and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it [and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
promise of fruit]: for my servants' sake I will not destroy all
Israel.</p>

<p>"Thus I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob and out of Judah,
an inheritor of my mountains, and mine elect and my servants
shall inherit it, and my fertile and abundant plains; but I will
destroy all others, because you have forgotten your God to
serve strange gods. I called, and ye did not answer; I spake,
and ye did not hear; and ye did choose the thing which I forbade.</p>

<p>"Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, my servants shall
eat, but ye shall be hungry; my servants shall rejoice, but ye
shall be ashamed; my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but
ye shall cry and howl for vexation of spirit.</p>

<p>"And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen:
for the Lord shall slay thee, and call His servants by another
name, that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless
himself in God, etc., because the former troubles are forgotten.</p>

<p>"For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the
former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</p>

<p>"But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create;
for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</p>

<p>"And I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people; and the
voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her, nor the voice
of crying.</p>

<p>"Before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet
speaking, I will hear. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together,
and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock; and dust shall be
the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my
holy mountain."</p>

<p>Is. lvi, 3: "Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do
justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness
to be revealed.</p>

<p>"Blessed is the man that doeth this, that keepeth the Sabbath,
and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.</p>

<p>"Neither let the strangers that have joined themselves to me,
say, God will separate me from His people. For thus saith the
Lord: Whoever will keep my Sabbath, and choose the things
that please me, and take hold of my covenant; even unto them
will I give in mine house a place and a name better than that
of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name,
that shall not be cut off."</p>

<p>Is. lix, 9: "Therefore for our iniquities is justice far from us:
we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>

stumble at noon day as in the night: we are in desolate places
as dead men.</p>

for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far
from us."</p>

<p>Is. lxvi, 18: "But I know their works and their thoughts;
it shall come that I will gather all nations and tongues, and they
shall see my glory.</p>

<p>"And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those
that escape of them unto the nations, to Africa, to Lydia, to
Italy, to Greece, and to the people that have not heard my
fame, neither have seen my glory. And they shall bring your
brethren."</p>

<p>Jer. vii. <i>Reprobation of the Temple</i>: "Go ye unto Shiloth,

wickedness of my people. And now, because ye have done all
these works, saith the Lord, I will do unto this house, wherein
my name is called upon, wherein ye trust, and unto the place
which I gave to your priests, as I have done to Shiloth." (For
I have rejected it, and made myself a temple elsewhere.)</p>

<p>"And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all
your brethren, even the seed of Ephraim." (Rejected for ever.)
"Therefore pray not for this people."</p>

<p>Jer. vii, 22: "What avails it you to add sacrifice to sacrifice?
For I spake not unto your fathers, when I brought them out
of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices.
But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey and be faithful
to my commandments, and I will be your God, and ye shall be
my people." (It was only after they had sacrificed to the golden
calf that I gave myself sacrifices to turn into good an evil custom.)</p>

<p>Daniel ii: "All thy soothsayers and wise men cannot shew
unto thee the secret which thou hast demanded. But there is
a God in heaven who can do so, and that hath revealed to thee
in thy dream what shall be in the latter days," (This dream
must have caused him much misgiving.)</p>

<p>"And it is not by my own wisdom that I have knowledge of
this secret, but by the revelation of this same God, that hath
revealed it to me, to make it manifest in thy presence.</p>

<p>"Thy dream was then of this kind. Thou sawest a great
image, high and terrible, which stood before thee. His head
was of gold, his breast and arms of silver, his belly and his thighs
of brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
Thus thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands,
which smote the image upon his feet, that were of iron and of
clay, and brake them to pieces.</p>

<p>"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the
gold broken to pieces together, and the wind carried them
away; but this stone that smote the image became a great
mountain, and filled the whole earth. This is the dream, and
now I will give thee the interpretation thereof.</p>

<p>"Thou who art the greatest of kings, and to whom God
hath given a power so vast that thou art renowned among all
peoples, art the head of gold which thou hast seen. But after
thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another
third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</p>

<p>"But the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, and even as
iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things, so shall this
empire break in pieces and bruise all.</p>

<p>"And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of clay
and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall
be in it of the strength of iron and of the weakness of clay.</p>

<p>"But as iron cannot be firmly mixed with clay, so they who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
are represented by the iron and by the clay, shall not cleave
one to another though united by marriage.</p>

<p>"Now in the days of these kings shall God set up a kingdom,
which shall never be destroyed, nor ever be delivered up to other
people. It shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms,
and it shall stand for ever, according as thou sawest that the
stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that
it fell from the mountain, and brake in pieces the iron, the
clay, the silver, and the gold. God hath made known to thee
what shall come to pass hereafter. This dream is certain, and
the interpretation thereof sure.</p>

<p>"Then Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face towards the
earth," etc.</p>

<p>Daniel viii, 8. "Daniel having seen the combat of the ram
and of the he-goat, who vanquished him and ruled over the
earth, whereof the principal horn being broken four others came
up toward the four winds of heaven, and out of one of them
came forth a little horn, which waxed exceedingly great toward
the south, and toward the east, and toward the land of Israel,
and it waxed great even to the host of heaven; and it cast down
some of the stars, and stamped upon them, and at last overthrew
the prince, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away,
and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</p>

<p>"This is what Daniel saw. He sought the meaning of it, and
a voice cried in this manner, 'Gabriel, make this man to understand
the vision,' And Gabriel said:</p>

<p>"The ram which thou sawest is the king of the Medes and
Persians, and the he-goat is the king of Greece, and the great
horn that is between his eyes is the first king of this monarchy.</p>

<p>"Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four
kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.</p>

<p>"And in the latter time of their kingdom, when iniquities
are come to the full, there shall arise a king, insolent and strong,
but not by his own power, to whom all things shall succeed after
his own will; and he shall destroy the holy people, and through
his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand, and
he shall destroy many. He shall also stand up against the
Prince of princes, but he shall perish miserably, and nevertheless
by a violent hand."</p>

<p>Daniel ix, 20. "Whilst I was praying with all my heart, and
confessing my sin and the sin of all my people, and prostrating
myself before my God, even Gabriel, whom I had seen in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
vision at the beginning, came to me and touched me about the
time of the evening oblation, and he informed me and said, O
Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee the knowledge of
things. At the beginning of thy supplications I came to shew
that which thou didst desire, for thou are greatly beloved:
therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.
Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy
holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins,
and to abolish iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness;
to accomplish the vision and the prophecies, and to anoint the
Most Holy. (After which this people shall be no more thy
people, nor this city the holy city. The times of wrath shall be
passed, and the years of grace shall come for ever.)</p>

<p>"Know therefore, and understand, that, from the going forth
of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the
Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and three score and
two weeks." (The Hebrews were accustomed to divide numbers,
and to place the small first. Thus, 7 and 62 make 69. Of this
70 there will then remain the 70th, that is to say, the 7 last
years of which he will speak next.)</p>

<p>"The street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous
times. And after three score and two weeks," (which have
followed the first seven. Christ will then be killed after the
sixty-nine weeks, that is to say, in the last week), "the Christ
shall be cut off, and a people of the prince that shall come shall
destroy the city and the sanctuary, and overwhelm all, and the
end of that war shall accomplish the desolation."</p>

<p>"Now one week," (which is the seventieth, which remains),
"shall confirm the covenant with many, and in the midst of the
week," (that is to say, the last three and a half years), "he shall
cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading
of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until
the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon
the desolate."</p>

<p>Daniel xi. "The angel said to Daniel: There shall stand up
yet," (after Cyrus, under whom this still is), "three kings in
Persia," (Cambyses, Smerdis, Darius); "and the fourth who
shall then come," (Xerxes) "shall be far richer than they all,
and far stronger, and shall stir up all his people against the
Greeks.</p>

<p>"But a mighty king shall stand up," (Alexander), "that shall
rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall
be divided in four parts toward the four winds of heaven," (as
he had said above, vii, 6; viii, 8), "but not his posterity; and his
successors shall not equal his power, for his kingdom shall be
plucked up, even for others besides these," (his four chief
successors).</p>

<p>"And the king of the south," (Ptolemy, son of Lagos, Egypt),
"shall be strong; but one of his princes shall be strong above
him, and his dominion shall be a great dominion," (Seleucus,
King of Syria. Appian says that he was the most powerful of
Alexander's successors).</p>

<p>"And in the end of years they shall join themselves together,
and the king's daughter of the south," (Berenice, daughter of
Ptolemy Philadelphus, son of the other Ptolemy), "shall come
to the king of the north," (to Antiochus Deus, King of Syria
and of Asia, son of Seleucus Lagidas), "to make peace between
these princes.</p>

<p>"But neither she nor her seed shall have a long authority;
for she and they that brought her, and her children, and her
friends, shall be delivered to death." (Berenice and her son
were killed by Seleucus Callinicus.)</p>

<p>"But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up,"
(Ptolemy Euergetes was the issue of the same father as Berenice),
"which shall come with a mighty army into the land of the
king of the north, where he shall put all under subjection, and
he shall also carry captive into Egypt their gods, their princes,
their gold, their silver, and all their precious spoils," (if he had
not been called into Egypt by domestic reasons, says Justin,
he would have entirely stripped Seleucus); "and he shall continue
several years when the king of the north can do nought
against him.</p>

<p>"And so he shall return into his kingdom. But his sons
shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great
forces," (Seleucus Ceraunus, Antiochus the Great). "And
their army shall come and overthrow all; wherefore the king of
the south shall be moved with choler, and shall also form a great
army, and fight him," (Ptolemy Philopator against Antiochus
the Great at Raphia), "and conquer; and his troops shall become
insolent, and his heart shall be lifted up," (this Ptolemy desecrated
the temple; Josephus): "he shall cast down many ten
thousands, but he shall not be strengthened by it. For the
king of the north," (Antiochus the Great), "shall return with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
greater multitude than before, and in those times also a great
number of enemies shall stand up against the king of the south,"
(during the reign of the young Ptolemy Epiphanes); "also the
apostates and robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to
establish the vision; but they shall fall." (Those who abandon
their religion to please Euergetes, when he will send his troops
to Scopas; for Antiochus will again take Scopas, and conquer
them.) "And the king of the north shall destroy the fenced cities,
and the arms of the south shall not withstand, and all shall yield
to his will; he shall stand in the land of Israel, and it shall yield
to him. And thus he shall think to make himself master of all
the empire of Egypt," (despising the youth of Epiphanes, says
Justin). "And for that he shall make alliance with him, and
give his daughter" (Cleopatra, in order that she may betray
her husband. On which Appian says that doubting his ability
to make himself master of Egypt by force, because of the protection
of the Romans, he wished to attempt it by cunning).
"He shall wish to corrupt her, but she shall not stand on his
side, neither be for him. Then he shall turn his face to other
designs, and shall think to make himself master of some isles,"
(that is to say, seaports), "and shall take many," (as Appian
says).</p>

<p>"But a prince shall oppose his conquests," (Scipio Africanus,
who stopped the progress of Antiochus the Great, because he
offended the Romans in the person of their allies), "and shall
cause the reproach offered by him to cease. He shall then
return into his kingdom and there perish, and be no more."
(He was slain by his soldiers.)</p>

<p>"And he who shall stand up in his estate," (Seleucus Philopator
or Soter, the son of Antiochus the Great), "shall be a tyrant, a
raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom," (which means the
people), "but within a few days he shall be destroyed, neither
in anger nor in battle. And in his place shall stand up a vile
person, unworthy of the honour of the kingdom, but he shall
come in cleverly by flatteries. All armies shall bend before
him; he shall conquer them, and even the prince with whom
he has made a covenant. For having renewed the league with
him, he shall work deceitfully, and enter with a small people
into his province, peaceably and without fear. He shall take
the fattest places, and shall do that which his fathers have not
done, and ravage on all sides. He shall forecast great devices
during his time."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_722" id="p_722"></a>722</h4>

<p><i>Prophecies.</i>—The seventy weeks of Daniel are ambiguous as
regards the term of commencement, because of the terms of the
prophecy; and as regards the term of conclusion, because of the
differences among chronologists. But all this difference extends
only to two hundred years.</p>


<h4><a name="p_723" id="p_723"></a>723</h4>

<p><i>Predictions.</i>—That in the fourth monarchy, before the destruction
of the second temple, before the dominion of the Jews was
taken away, in the seventieth week of Daniel, during the continuance
of the second temple, the heathen should be instructed,
and brought to the knowledge of the God worshipped by the
Jews; that those who loved Him should be delivered from their
enemies, and filled with His fear and love.</p>

<p>And it happened that in the fourth monarchy, before the
destruction of the second temple, etc., the heathen in great
number worshipped God, and led an angelic life. Maidens
dedicated their virginity and their life to God. Men renounced
their pleasures. What Plato could only make acceptable to a
few men, specially chosen and instructed, a secret influence
imparted, by the power of a few words, to a hundred million
ignorant men.</p>

<p>The rich left their wealth. Children left the dainty homes of
their parents to go into the rough desert. (See Philo the Jew.)
All this was foretold a great while ago. For two thousand
years no heathen had worshipped the God of the Jews; and at
the time foretold, a great number of the heathen worshipped
this only God. The temples were destroyed. The very kings
made submission to the cross. All this was due to the Spirit
of God, which was spread abroad upon the earth.</p>

<p>No heathen, since Moses until Jesus Christ, believed according
to the very Rabbis. A great number of the heathen, after
Jesus Christ, believed in the books of Moses, kept them in
substance and spirit, and only rejected what was useless.</p>

<p>"It is a tradition among us, that, when the Messiah shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
come, the house of God, destined for the dispensation of His
Word, shall be full of filth and impurity; and that the wisdom
of the scribes shall be corrupt and rotten. Those who shall be
afraid to sin, shall be rejected by the people, and treated as
senseless fools."</p>

<p>Is. xlix: "Listen, O isles, unto me, and hearken, ye people,
from afar: The Lord hath called me by my name from the
womb of my mother; in the shadow of His hand hath He hid me,
and hath made my words like a sharp sword, and said unto me,
Thou art my servant in whom I will be glorified. Then I said,
Lord, have I laboured in vain? have I spent my strength for
nought? yet surely my judgment is with Thee, O Lord, and
my work with Thee. And now, saith the Lord, that formed
me from the womb to be His servant, to bring Jacob and Israel
again to Him, Thou shalt be glorious in my sight, and I will be
thy strength. It is a light thing that thou shouldst convert the
tribes of Jacob; I have raised thee up for a light to the Gentiles,
that thou mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the earth.
Thus saith the Lord to him whom man despiseth, to him whom
the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Princes and kings
shall worship thee, because the Lord is faithful that hath chosen
thee.</p>

<p>"Again saith the Lord unto me, I have heard thee in the
days of salvation and of mercy, and I will preserve thee for a
covenant of the people, to cause to inherit the desolate nations,
that thou mayest say to the prisoners: Go forth; to them that
are in darkness show yourselves, and possess these abundant and
fertile lands. They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall
the heat nor sun smite them; for he that hath mercy upon them
shall lead them, even by the springs of waters shall he guide
them, and make the mountains a way before them. Behold,
the peoples shall come from all parts, from the east and from
the west, from the north and from the south. Let the heavens
give glory to God; let the earth be joyful; for it hath pleased
the Lord to comfort His people, and He will have mercy upon
the poor who hope in Him.</p>

<p>"Yet Sion dared to say: The Lord hath forsaken me, and hath
forgotten me. Can a woman forget her child, that she should
not have compassion on the son of her womb? but if she forget,
yet will not I forget thee, O Sion. I will bear thee always
between my hands, and thy walls are continually before me.
They that shall build thee are come, and thy destroyers shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
go forth of thee. Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold;
all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As
I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them
all, as with an ornament. Thy waste and thy desolate places,
and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow
by reason of the inhabitants, and the children thou shalt have
after thy barrenness shall say again in thy ears: The place is
too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell. Then
shalt thou say in thy heart: Who hath begotten me these, seeing
I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing
to and fro? and who brought up these? Behold, I was left
alone; these, where had they been? And the Lord shall say to
thee: Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set
up my standard to the people; and they shall bring thy sons
in their arms and in their bosoms. And kings shall be their
nursing fathers, and queens their nursing mothers; they shall
bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up
the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord;
for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me. Shall the prey
be taken from the mighty? But even if the captives be taken
away from the strong, nothing shall hinder me from saving thy
children, and from destroying thy enemies; and all flesh shall
know that I am the Lord, thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the
mighty One of Jacob.</p>

<p>"Thus saith the Lord: What is the bill of this divorcement,
wherewith I have put away the synagogue? and why have I
delivered it into the hands of your enemies? Is it not for your
iniquities and for your transgressions that I have put it away?</p>

<p>"For I came, and no man received me; I called and there
was none to hear. Is my arm shortened, that I cannot redeem?</p>

<p>"Therefore I will show the tokens of mine anger; I will clothe
the heavens with darkness, and make sackcloth their covering.</p>

<p>"The Lord hath given me the tongue of the learned that I
should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary.
He hath opened mine ear, and I have listened to Him as a master.</p>

<p>"The Lord hath revealed His will, and I was not rebellious.</p>

<p>"I gave my body to the smiters, and my cheeks to outrage;
I hid not my face from shame and spitting. But the Lord hath
helped me; therefore I have not been confounded.</p>

<p>"He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me?
who will be mine adversary, and accuse me of sin, God himself
being my protector?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"All men shall pass away, and be consumed by time; let
those that fear God hearken to the voice of His servant; let
him that languisheth in darkness put his trust in the Lord.
But as for you, ye do but kindle the wrath of God upon you; ye
walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks that ye have
kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down
in sorrow.</p>

<p>"Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that
seek the Lord: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to
the hole of the pit whence ye are digged. Look unto Abraham,
your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone,
when childless, and increased him. Behold, I have comforted
Zion, and heaped upon her blessings and consolations.</p>

<p>"Hearken unto me, my people, and give ear unto me: for a
law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to
rest for a light of the Gentiles."</p>

<p>Amos viii. The prophet, having enumerated the sins of
Israel, said that God had sworn to take vengeance on them.</p>

<p>He says this: "And it shall come to pass in that day, saith
the Lord, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and
I will darken the earth in the clear day; and I will turn your
feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation.</p>

<p>"You all shall have sorrow and suffering, and I will make
this nation mourn as for an only son, and the end therefore as
a bitter day. Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I
will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst
for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. And they
shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the
east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and
shall not find it.</p>

<p>"In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for
thirst. They that have followed the idols of Samaria, and
sworn by the god of Dan, and followed the manner of Beersheba,
shall fall, and never rise up again."</p>

<p>Amos iii, 2: "Ye only have I known of all the families of the
earth for my people."</p>

<p>Daniel xii, 7. Having described all the extent of the reign
of the Messiah, he says: "All these things shall be finished, when
the scattering of the people of Israel shall be accomplished."</p>

<p>Haggai ii, 4: "Ye who, comparing this second house with the
glory of the first, despise it, be strong, saith the Lord, be strong,
O Zerubbabel, and O Jesus, the high priest, be strong, all ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
people of the land, and work. For I am with you, saith the
Lord of hosts; according to the word that I covenanted with
you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among
you. Fear ye not. For thus saith the Lord of hosts: Yet one
little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the
sea, and the dry land," (a way of speaking to indicate a great
and an extraordinary change); "and I will shake all nations,
and the desire of all the Gentiles shall come; and I will fill this
house with glory, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>"The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord,"
(that is to say, it is not by that that I wish to be honoured; as
it is said elsewhere: All the beasts of the field are mine, what
advantages me that they are offered me in sacrifice?). "The
glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former,
saith the Lord of hosts; and in this place will I establish my house,
saith the Lord.</p>

<p>"According to all that thou desiredst in Horeb in the day of
the assembly, saying, Let us not hear again the voice of the Lord,
neither let us see this fire any more, that we die not.<a name="FNanchor_272_276" id="FNanchor_272_276"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_272_276" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> And the
Lord said unto me, Their prayer is just. I will raise them up a
prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will
put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all
that I shall command him. And it shall come to pass, that
whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he will speak
in my name, I will require it of him."</p>

<p>Genesis xlix: "Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall
praise, and thou shalt conquer thine enemies; thy father's
children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion's whelp:
from the prey, my son, thou art gone up, and art couched as
a lion, and as a lioness that shall be roused up.</p>

<p>"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver
from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the
gathering of the people be."</p>

<p>His forerunner. Malachi iii.</p>

<p>He will be born an infant. Is. ix.</p>

<p>He will be born in the village of Bethlehem. Micah v. He
will appear chiefly in Jerusalem, and will be a descendant of
the family of Judah and of David.</p>

<p>He is to blind the learned and the wise, Is. vi, viii, xxix, etc.;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and to preach the Gospel to the lowly, Is. xxix; to open the
eyes of the blind, give health to the sick, and bring light to those
that languish in darkness. Is. lxi.</p>

<p>He is to show the perfect way, and be the teacher of the
Gentiles. Is. lv; xlii, 1-7.</p>

<p>The prophecies are to be unintelligible to the wicked, Dan. xii;
Hosea xiv, 10; but they are to be intelligible to those who are
well informed.</p>

<p>The prophecies, which represent Him as poor, represent Him
as master of the nations. Is. lii, 14, etc.; liii; Zech. ix, 9.</p>

<p>The prophecies, which foretell the time, foretell Him only as
master of the nations and suffering, and not as in the clouds
nor as judge. And those, which represent Him thus as judge
and in glory, do not mention the time. When the Messiah is
spoken of as great and glorious, it is as the judge of the world,
and not its Redeemer.</p>

<p>He is to be the victim for the sins of the world. Is. xxxix,
liii, etc.</p>

<p>He is to be the precious corner-stone. Is. xxviii, 16.</p>

<p>He is to be a stone of stumbling and offence. Is. viii. Jerusalem
is to dash against this stone.</p>

<p>The builders are to reject this stone. Ps. cxvii, 22.</p>

<p>God is to make this stone the chief corner-stone.</p>

<p>And this stone is to grow into a huge mountain, and fill the
whole earth. Dan. ii.</p>

<p>So He is to be rejected, despised, betrayed (Ps. cviii, 8), sold
(Zech. xi, 12), spit upon, buffeted, mocked, afflicted in innumerable
ways, given gall to drink (Ps. lxviii), pierced (Zech. xii),
His feet and His hands pierced, slain, and lots cast for His
raiment.</p>

<p>He will raise again (Ps. xv) the third day (Hosea vi, 3).</p>

<p>He will ascend to heaven to sit on the right hand. Ps. cx.</p>

<p>The kings will arm themselves against Him. Ps. ii.</p>

<p>Being on the right hand of the Father, He will be victorious
over His enemies.</p>

<p>The kings of the earth and all nations will worship Him. Is. lx.</p>

<p>The Jews will continue as a nation. Jeremiah.</p>

<p>They will wander, without kings, etc. (Hosea iii), without
prophets (Amos), looking for salvation and finding it not (Isaiah).</p>

<p>Calling of the Gentiles by Jesus Christ. Is. lii, 15; lv, 5; lx,

<p>It was not lawful to sacrifice outside of Jerusalem, which was
the place that the Lord had chosen, nor even to eat the tithes
elsewhere. Deut. xii, 5, etc.; Deut. xiv, 23, etc.; xv, 20;
xvi, 2, 7, 11, 15.</p>

<p>Hosea foretold that they should be without a king, without
a prince, without a sacrifice, and without an idol; and this
prophecy is now fulfilled, as they cannot make a lawful sacrifice
out of Jerusalem.</p>


<h4><a name="p_728" id="p_728"></a>728</h4>

<p><i>Predictions.</i>—It was foretold that, in the time of the Messiah,
He should come to establish a new covenant, which should make
them forget the escape from Egypt (Jer. xxiii, 5; Is. xliii, 10);
that He should place His law not in externals, but in the heart;
that He should put His fear, which had only been from without,
in the midst of the heart. Who does not see the Christian law
in all this?</p>


<h4><a name="p_729" id="p_729"></a>729</h4>

<p>... That then idolatry would be overthrown; that this
Messiah would cast down all idols, and bring men into the worship
of the true God.</p>

<p>That the temples of the idols would be cast down, and that
among all nations, and in all places of the earth, He would be
offered a pure sacrifice, not of beasts.</p>

<p>That He would be king of the Jews and Gentiles. And we
see this king of the Jews and Gentiles oppressed by both, who
conspire His death; and ruler of both, destroying the worship of
Moses in Jerusalem, which was its centre, where He made His
first Church; and also the worship of idols in Rome, the centre
of it, where He made His chief Church.</p>


<h4><a name="p_730" id="p_730"></a>730</h4>

<p><i>Prophecies.</i>—That Jesus Christ will sit on the right hand,
till God has subdued His enemies.</p>

<p>Therefore He will not subdue them Himself.</p>

my fear <i>in your heart</i>."</p>

<p>All that is the same thing. To prophesy is to speak of God,
not from outward proofs, but from an inward and immediate
feeling.</p>


<h4><a name="p_732" id="p_732"></a>732</h4>

<p>That He would teach men the perfect way.</p>

<p>And there has never come, before Him nor after Him, any
man who has taught anything divine approaching to this.</p>


<h4><a name="p_733" id="p_733"></a>733</h4>

<p>... That Jesus Christ would be small in His beginning, and
would then increase. The little stone of Daniel.</p>

<p>If I had in no wise heard of the Messiah, nevertheless, after
such wonderful predictions of the course of the world which I
see fulfilled, I see that He is divine. And if I knew that these
same books foretold a Messiah, I should be sure that He would
come; and seeing that they place His time before the destruction
of the second temple, I should say that He had come.</p>

<p><i>Prophecies.</i>—That the Jews would reject Jesus Christ, and
would be rejected of God, for this reason, that the chosen vine
brought forth only wild grapes. That the chosen people would
be fruitless, ungrateful, and unbelieving, <i>populum non credentem

would go before Him.</p>

<p><i>Transfixerunt.</i> Zech. xii, 10.</p>

<p>That a deliverer should come, who would crush the demon's
head, and free His people from their sins, <i>ex omnibus iniquitatibus</i>;
that there should be a New Covenant, which would be eternal;
that there should be another priesthood after the order of
Melchisedek, and it should be eternal; that the Christ should be
glorious, mighty, strong, and yet so poor that He would not
be recognised, nor taken for what He is, but rejected and slain;
that His people who denied Him should no longer be His people;
that the idolaters should receive Him, and take refuge in Him;
that He should leave Zion to reign in the centre of idolatry; that
nevertheless the Jews should continue for ever; that He should
be of Judah, and when there should be no longer a king.</p>

<h3>PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST</h3>


<h4><a name="p_736" id="p_736"></a>736</h4>

<p>... Therefore I reject all other religions. In that way I find
an answer to all objections. It is right that a God so pure
should only reveal Himself to those whose hearts are purified.
Hence this religion is lovable to me, and I find it now sufficiently
justified by so divine a morality. But I find more in it.</p>

<p>I find it convincing that, since the memory of man has lasted,
it was constantly announced to men that they were universally
corrupt, but that a Redeemer should come; that it was not one
man who said it, but innumerable men, and a whole nation
expressly made for the purpose, and prophesying for four
thousand years. This is a nation which is more ancient than
every other nation. Their books, scattered abroad, are four
thousand years old.</p>

<p>The more I examine them, the more truths I find in them:
an entire nation foretell Him before His advent, and an entire
nation worship Him after His advent; what has preceded and
what has followed; in short, people without idols and kings, this
synagogue which was foretold, and these wretches who frequent
it, and who, being our enemies, are admirable witnesses of the
truth of these prophecies, wherein their wretchedness and even
their blindness are foretold.</p>

<p>I find this succession, this religion, wholly divine in its
authority, in its duration, in its perpetuity, in its morality,
in its conduct, in its doctrine, in its effects. The frightful
darkness of the Jews was foretold: <i>Eris palpans in meridie.<a name="FNanchor_276_280" id="FNanchor_276_280"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_276_280" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
Dabitur liber scienti literas, et dicet: Non possum legere.</i><a name="FNanchor_277_281" id="FNanchor_277_281"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_277_281" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> While
the sceptre was still in the hands of the first foreign usurper,
there is the report of the coming of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>So I hold out my arms to my <i>Redeemer</i>, who, having been
foretold for four thousand years, has come to suffer and to die
for me on earth, at the time and under all the circumstances
foretold. By His grace, I await death in peace, in the hope of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
being eternally united to Him. Yet I live with joy, whether
in the prosperity which it pleases Him to bestow upon me, or
in the adversity which He sends for my good, and which He has
taught me to bear by His example.</p>


<h4><a name="p_737" id="p_737"></a>737</h4>

<p>The prophecies having given different signs which should
all happen at the advent of the Messiah, it was necessary that
all these signs should occur at the same time. So it was
necessary that the fourth monarchy should have come, when
the seventy weeks of Daniel were ended; and that the sceptre
should have then departed from Judah. And all this happened
without any difficulty. Then it was necessary that the Messiah
should come; and Jesus Christ then came, who was called the
Messiah. And all this again was without difficulty. This indeed
shows the truth of the prophecies.</p>


<h4><a name="p_738" id="p_738"></a>738</h4>

<p>The prophets foretold, and were not foretold. The saints
again were foretold, but did not foretell. Jesus Christ both
foretold and was foretold.</p>


<h4><a name="p_739" id="p_739"></a>739</h4>

<p>Jesus Christ, whom the two Testaments regard, the Old as
its hope, the New as its model, and both as their centre.</p>


<h4><a name="p_740" id="p_740"></a>740</h4>

<p>The two oldest books in the world are those of Moses and
Job, the one a Jew and the other a Gentile. Both of them
look upon Jesus Christ as their common centre and object:
Moses in relating the promises of God to Abraham, Jacob, etc.,
and his prophecies; and Job, <i>Quis mihi det ut</i>,<a name="FNanchor_278_282" id="FNanchor_278_282"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_278_282" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> etc. <i>Scio enim
quod redemptor meus vivit</i>, etc.</p>


<h4><a name="p_741" id="p_741"></a>741</h4>

<p>The Gospel only speaks of the virginity of the Virgin up to
the time of the birth of Jesus Christ. All with reference to
Jesus Christ.</p>


<h4><a name="p_742" id="p_742"></a>742</h4>

<p><i>Proofs of Jesus Christ.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Why was the book of Ruth preserved?</p>

<p>Why the story of Tamar?</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_743" id="p_743"></a>743</h4>

<p>"Pray that ye enter not into temptation."<a name="FNanchor_279_283" id="FNanchor_279_283"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_279_283" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> It is dangerous
to be tempted; and people are tempted because they do not pray.</p>

<p><i>Et tu conversus confirma fratres tuos.</i> But before, <i>conversus
Jesus respexit Petrum</i>.</p>

<p>Saint Peter asks permission to strike Malchus, and strikes
before hearing the answer. Jesus Christ replies afterwards.</p>

<p>The word, <i>Galilee</i>, which the Jewish mob pronounced as if
by chance, in accusing Jesus Christ before Pilate, afforded
Pilate a reason for sending Jesus Christ to Herod. And thereby
the mystery was accomplished, that He should be judged by
Jews and Gentiles. Chance was apparently the cause of the
accomplishment of the mystery.</p>


<h4><a name="p_744" id="p_744"></a>744</h4>

<p>Those who have a difficulty in believing seek a reason in the
fact that the Jews do not believe. "Were this so clear," say
they, "why did the Jews not believe?" And they almost
wish that they had believed, so as not to be kept back by the
example of their refusal. But it is their very refusal that is the
foundation of our faith. We should be much less disposed to
the faith, if they were on our side. We should then have a
more ample pretext. The wonderful thing is to have made the
Jews great lovers of the things foretold, and great enemies of
their fulfilment.</p>


<h4><a name="p_745" id="p_745"></a>745</h4>

<p>The Jews were accustomed to great and striking miracles,
and so, having had the great miracles of the Red Sea and of the
land of Canaan as an epitome of the great deeds of their Messiah,
they therefore looked for more striking miracles, of which
those of Moses were only the patterns.</p>


<h4><a name="p_746" id="p_746"></a>746</h4>

<p>The carnal Jews and the heathen have their calamities, and
Christians also. There is no Redeemer for the heathen, for they
do not so much as hope for one. There is no Redeemer for the
Jews; they hope for Him in vain. There is a Redeemer only
for Christians. (See <i>Perpetuity</i>.)</p>


<h4><a name="p_747" id="p_747"></a>747</h4>

<p>In the time of the Messiah the people divided themselves.
The spiritual embraced the Messiah, and the coarser-minded
remained to serve as witnesses of Him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_748" id="p_748"></a>748</h4>

<p>"If this was clearly foretold to the Jews, how did they not
believe it, or why were they not destroyed for resisting a fact
so clear?"</p>

<p>I reply: in the first place, it was foretold both that they
would not believe a thing so clear, and that they would not be
destroyed. And nothing is more to the glory of the Messiah;
for it was not enough that there should be prophets; their
prophets must be kept above suspicion. Now, etc.</p>


<h4><a name="p_749" id="p_749"></a>749</h4>

<p>If the Jews had all been converted by Jesus Christ, we should
have none but questionable witnesses. And if they had been
entirely destroyed, we should have no witnesses at all.</p>


<h4><a name="p_750" id="p_750"></a>750</h4>

<p>What do the prophets say of Jesus Christ? That He will be
clearly God? No; but that He is a God truly hidden; that He
will be slighted; that none will think that it is He; that He will
be a stone of stumbling, upon which many will stumble, etc.
Let people then reproach us no longer for want of clearness,
since we make profession of it.</p>

<p>But, it is said, there are obscurities.—And without that, no
one would have stumbled over Jesus Christ, and this is one
of the formal pronouncements of the prophets: <i>Excæca</i><a name="FNanchor_280_284" id="FNanchor_280_284"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_280_284" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> ...</p>


<h4><a name="p_751" id="p_751"></a>751</h4>

<p>Moses first teaches the Trinity, original sin, the Messiah.</p>

<p>David: a great witness; a king, good, merciful, a beautiful
soul, a sound mind, powerful. He prophesies, and his wonder
comes to pass. This is infinite.</p>

<p>He had only to say that he was the Messiah, if he had been
vain; for the prophecies are clearer about him than about Jesus
Christ. And the same with Saint John.</p>


<h4><a name="p_752" id="p_752"></a>752</h4>

<p>Herod was believed to be the Messiah. He had taken away
the sceptre from Judah, but he was not of Judah. This gave
rise to a considerable sect.</p>

<p>Curse of the Greeks upon those who count three periods of
time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>In what way should the Messiah come, seeing that through
Him the sceptre was to be eternally in Judah, and at His coming
the sceptre was to be taken away from Judah?</p>

<p>In order to effect that seeing they should not see, and hearing
they should not understand, nothing could be better done.</p>


<h4><a name="p_753" id="p_753"></a>753</h4>

<p><i>Homo existens te Deum facit.</i></p>

<p><i>Scriptum est, Dii estis, et non potest solvi Scriptura.</i></p>

<p><i>Hæc infirmitas non est ad vitam et est ad mortem.</i></p>

<h4><a name="p_754" id="p_754"></a>754</h4>

<p>The apparent discrepancy of the Gospels.<a name="FNanchor_282_286" id="FNanchor_282_286"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_282_286" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>


<h4><a name="p_755" id="p_755"></a>755</h4>

<p>What can we have but reverence for a man who foretells
plainly things which come to pass, and who declares his intention
both to blind and to enlighten, and who intersperses obscurities
among the clear things which come to pass?</p>


<h4><a name="p_756" id="p_756"></a>756</h4>

<p>The time of the first advent was foretold; the time of the
second is not so; because the first was to be obscure, and the
second is to be brilliant, and so manifest that even His enemies
will recognise it. But, as He was first to come only in obscurity,
and to be known only of those who searched the Scriptures ...</p>


<h4><a name="p_757" id="p_757"></a>757</h4>

<p>God, in order to cause the Messiah to be known by the good
and not to be known by the wicked, made Him to be foretold
in this manner. If the manner of the Messiah had been clearly
foretold, there would have been no obscurity, even for the
wicked. If the time had been obscurely foretold, there would
have been obscurity, even for the good. For their [goodness
of heart] would not have made them understand, for instance,
that the closed <i>mem</i> signifies six hundred years. But the time
has been clearly foretold, and the manner in types.</p>

<p>By this means, the wicked, taking the promised blessings
for material blessings, have fallen into error, in spite of the
clear prediction of the time; and the good have not fallen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
error. For the understanding of the promised blessings depends
on the heart, which calls "good" that which it loves; but the
understanding of the promised time does not depend on the
heart. And thus the clear prediction of the time, and the
obscure prediction of the blessings, deceive the wicked alone.</p>


<h4><a name="p_758" id="p_758"></a>758</h4>

<p>[Either the Jews or the Christians must be wicked.]</p>


<h4><a name="p_759" id="p_759"></a>759</h4>

<p>The Jews reject Him, but not all. The saints receive Him,
and not the carnal-minded. And so far is this from being
against His glory, that it is the last touch which crowns it.
For their argument, the only one found in all their writings, in
the Talmud and in the Rabbinical writings, amounts only to
this, that Jesus Christ has not subdued the nations with sword
in hand, <i>gladiumt uum, potentissime</i>.<a name="FNanchor_283_287" id="FNanchor_283_287"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_283_287" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> (Is this all they have to
say? Jesus Christ has been slain, say they. He has failed. He
has not subdued the heathen with His might. He has not
bestowed upon us their spoil. He does not give riches. Is
this all they have to say? It is in this respect that He is lovable
to me. I would not desire Him whom they fancy.) It is evident
that it is only His life which has prevented them from accepting
Him; and through this rejection they are irreproachable
witnesses, and, what is more, they thereby accomplish the
prophecies.</p>

<p>[By means of the fact that this people have not accepted
Him, this miracle here has happened. The prophecies were
the only lasting miracles which could be wrought, but they
were liable to be denied.]</p>


<h4><a name="p_760" id="p_760"></a>760</h4>

<p>The Jews, in slaying Him in order not to receive Him as the
Messiah, have given Him the final proof of being the Messiah.</p>

<p>And in continuing not to recognise Him, they made themselves
irreproachable witnesses. Both in slaying Him, and
in continuing to deny Him, they have fulfilled the prophecies
(Isa. lx; Ps. lxxi).</p>


<h4><a name="p_761" id="p_761"></a>761</h4>

<p>What could the Jews, His enemies, do? If they receive Him,
they give proof of Him by their reception; for then the guardians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
of the expectation of the Messiah receive Him. If they reject
Him, they give proof of Him by their rejection.</p>


<h4><a name="p_762" id="p_762"></a>762</h4>

<p>The Jews, in testing if He were God, have shown that He was
man.</p>


<h4><a name="p_763" id="p_763"></a>763</h4>

<p>The Church has had as much difficulty in showing that Jesus
Christ was man, against those who denied it, as in showing that
he was God; and the probabilities were equally great.</p>


<h4><a name="p_764" id="p_764"></a>764</h4>

<p><i>Source of contradictions.</i>—A God humiliated, even to the
death on the cross; a Messiah triumphing over death by his
own death. Two natures in Jesus Christ, two advents, two
states of man's nature.</p>


<h4><a name="p_765" id="p_765"></a>765</h4>

<p><i>Types.</i>—Saviour, father, sacrificer, offering, food, king, wise,
law-giver, afflicted, poor, having to create a people whom He
must lead and nourish, and bring into His land....</p>

<p><i>Jesus Christ. Offices.</i>—He alone had to create a great people,
elect, holy, and chosen; to lead, nourish, and bring it into the
place of rest and holiness; to make it holy to God; to make it
the temple of God; to reconcile it to, and save it from, the
wrath of God; to free it from the slavery of sin, which
visibly reigns in man; to give laws to this people, and engrave
these laws on their heart; to offer Himself to God for them, and
sacrifice Himself for them; to be a victim without blemish, and
Himself the sacrificer, having to offer Himself, His body, and
His blood, and yet to offer bread and wine to God ...</p>

and are wanderers.</p>


<h4><a name="p_766" id="p_766"></a>766</h4>

<p>Of all that is on earth, He partakes only of the sorrows, not
of the joys. He loves His neighbours, but His love does not
confine itself within these bounds, and overflows to His own
enemies, and then to those of God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_767" id="p_767"></a>767</h4>

<p>Jesus Christ typified by Joseph, the beloved of his father,
sent by his father to see his brethren, etc., innocent, sold by
his brethren for twenty pieces of silver, and thereby becoming
their lord, their saviour, the saviour of strangers, and the
saviour of the world; which had not been but for their plot to
destroy him, their sale and their rejection of him.</p>

<p>In prison Joseph innocent between two criminals; Jesus
Christ on the cross between two thieves. Joseph foretells
freedom to the one, and death to the other, from the same
omens. Jesus Christ saves the elect, and condemns the outcast
for the same sins. Joseph foretells only; Jesus Christ acts.
Joseph asks him who will be saved to remember him, when
he comes into his glory; and he whom Jesus Christ saves asks
that He will remember him, when He comes into His kingdom.</p>


<h4><a name="p_768" id="p_768"></a>768</h4>

<p>The conversion of the heathen was only reserved for the grace
of the Messiah. The Jews have been so long in opposition to
them without success; all that Solomon and the prophets said
has been useless. Sages, like Plato and Socrates, have not
been able to persuade them.</p>


<h4><a name="p_769" id="p_769"></a>769</h4>

<p>After many persons had gone before, Jesus Christ at last
came to say:<a name="FNanchor_286_290" id="FNanchor_286_290"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_286_290" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> "Here am I, and this is the time. That which
the prophets have said was to come in the fullness of time, I tell
you My apostles will do. The Jews shall be cast out. Jerusalem
shall be soon destroyed. And the heathen shall enter into the
knowledge of God. My apostles shall do this after you have
slain the heir of the vineyard."</p>

<p>Then the apostles said to the Jews: "You shall be accursed,"
(<i>Celsus laughed at it</i>); and to the heathen, "You shall enter into
the knowledge of God." And this then came to pass.</p>


<h4><a name="p_770" id="p_770"></a>770</h4>

<p>Jesus Christ came to blind those who saw clearly, and to give
sight to the blind; to heal the sick, and leave the healthy to die;
to call to repentance, and to justify sinners, and to leave the
righteous in their sins; to fill the needy, and leave the rich empty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

unbelief and lust. The whole world now became fervent with
love. Princes abandoned their pomp; maidens suffered martyrdom.
Whence came this influence? The Messiah was come.
These were the effect and sign of His coming.</p>

Law. But, in speaking of Jesus Christ, we must say: <i>Fecit

to Jesus Christ to be universal. Even the Church offers sacrifice
only for the faithful. Jesus Christ offered that of the cross for all.</p>

<p>The types of the completeness of the Redemption, as that the
sun gives light to all, indicate only completeness; but [<i>the types</i>]
of exclusions, as of the Jews elected to the exclusion of the
Gentiles, indicate exclusion.</p>

<p>"Jesus Christ the Redeemer of all."—Yes, for He has offered,
like a man who has ransomed all those who were willing to come
to Him. If any die on the way, it is their misfortune; but, so
far as He was concerned, He offered them redemption.—That
holds good in this example, where he who ransoms and he who
prevents death are two persons, but not of Jesus Christ, who
does both these things.—No, for Jesus Christ, in the quality of
Redeemer, is not perhaps Master of all; and thus, in so far as it is
in Him, He is the Redeemer of all.</p>

<p>When it is said that Jesus Christ did not die for all, you
take undue advantage of a fault in men who at once apply this
exception to themselves; and this is to favour despair, instead
of turning them from it to favour hope. For men thus accustom
themselves in inward virtues by outward customs.</p>

<h4><a name="p_782" id="p_782"></a>782</h4>

<p>... Then Jesus Christ comes to tell men that they have no
other enemies but themselves; that it is their passions which
keep them apart from God; that He comes to destroy these,
and give them His grace, so as to make of them all one Holy
Church; that He comes to bring back into this Church the
heathen and Jews; that He comes to destroy the idols of the
former and the superstition of the latter. To this all men are
opposed, not only from the natural opposition of lust; but,
above all, the kings of the earth, as had been foretold, join
together to destroy this religion at its birth. (<i>Proph.: Quare
fremuerunt gentes ... reges terræ ... adversus Christum.</i>)<a name="FNanchor_314_318" id="FNanchor_314_318"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_314_318" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>All that is great on earth is united together; the learned, the
wise, the kings. The first write; the second condemn; the last
kill. And notwithstanding all these oppositions, these men,
simple and weak, resist all these powers, subdue even these
kings, these learned men and these sages, and remove idolatry
from all the earth. And all this is done by the power which
had foretold it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_783" id="p_783"></a>783</h4>

<p>Jesus Christ would not have the testimony of devils, nor of
those who were not called, but of God and John the Baptist.</p>


<h4><a name="p_784" id="p_784"></a>784</h4>

<p>I consider Jesus Christ in all persons and in ourselves: Jesus
Christ as a Father in His Father, Jesus Christ as a Brother in
His Brethren, Jesus Christ as poor in the poor, Jesus Christ as
rich in the rich, Jesus Christ as Doctor and Priest in priests,
Jesus Christ as Sovereign in princes, etc. For by His glory He
is all that is great, being God; and by His mortal life He is all
that is poor and abject. Therefore He has taken this unhappy
condition, so that He could be in all persons, and the model of
all conditions.</p>


<h4><a name="p_785" id="p_785"></a>785</h4>

<p>Jesus Christ is an obscurity (according to what the world
calls obscurity), such that historians, writing only of important
matters of states, have hardly noticed Him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_786" id="p_786"></a>786</h4>

<p><i>On the fact that neither Josephus, nor Tacitus, nor other historians
have spoken of Jesus Christ.</i>—So far is this from telling against
Christianity, that on the contrary it tells for it. For it is certain
that Jesus Christ has existed; that His religion has made a great
talk; and that these persons were not ignorant of it. Thus it
is plain that they purposely concealed it, or that, if they did
speak of it, their account has been suppressed or changed.</p>


<h4><a name="p_787" id="p_787"></a>787</h4>

<p>"I have reserved me seven thousand."<a name="FNanchor_315_319" id="FNanchor_315_319"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_315_319" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> I love the worshippers
unknown to the world and to the very prophets.</p>


<h4><a name="p_788" id="p_788"></a>788</h4>

<p>As Jesus Christ remained unknown among men, so His truth
remains among common opinions without external difference.
Thus the Eucharist among ordinary bread.</p>


<h4><a name="p_789" id="p_789"></a>789</h4>

<p>Jesus would not be slain without the forms of justice; for it is
far more ignominious to die by justice than by an unjust sedition.</p>


<h4><a name="p_790" id="p_790"></a>790</h4>

<p>The false justice of Pilate only serves to make Jesus Christ
suffer; for he causes Him to be scourged by his false justice,
and afterwards puts Him to death. It would have been better
to have put Him to death at once. Thus it is with the falsely
just. They do good and evil works to please the world, and to
show that they are not altogether of Jesus Christ; for they are
ashamed of Him. And at last, under great temptation and on
great occasions, they kill Him.</p>


<h4><a name="p_791" id="p_791"></a>791</h4>

<p>What man ever had more renown? The whole Jewish people
foretell Him before His coming. The Gentile people worship
Him after His coming. The two peoples, Gentile and Jewish,
regard Him as their centre.</p>

<p>And yet what man enjoys this renown less? Of thirty-three
years, He lives thirty without appearing. For three years He
passes as an impostor; the priests and the chief people reject
Him; His friends and His nearest relatives despise Him. Finally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
He dies, betrayed by one of His own disciples, denied by another,
and abandoned by all.</p>

<p>What part, then, has He in this renown? Never had man so
much renown; never had man more ignominy. All that renown
has served only for us, to render us capable of recognising Him;
and He had none of it for Himself.</p>


<h4><a name="p_792" id="p_792"></a>792</h4>

<p>The infinite distance between body and mind is a symbol of
the infinitely more infinite distance between mind and charity;
for charity is supernatural.</p>

<p>All the glory of greatness has no lustre for people who are in
search of understanding.</p>

<p>The greatness of clever men is invisible to kings, to the rich,
to chiefs, and to all the worldly great.</p>

<p>The greatness of wisdom, which is nothing if not of God, is
invisible to the carnal-minded and to the clever. These are
three orders differing in kind.</p>

<p>Great geniuses have their power, their glory, their greatness,
their victory, their lustre, and have no need of worldly greatness,
with which they are not in keeping. They are seen, not by the
eye, but by the mind; this is sufficient.</p>

<p>The saints have their power, their glory, their victory, their
lustre, and need no worldly or intellectual greatness, with which
they have no affinity; for these neither add anything to them,
nor take away anything from them. They are seen of God
and the angels, and not of the body, nor of the curious mind.
God is enough for them.</p>

<p>Archimedes,<a name="FNanchor_316_320" id="FNanchor_316_320"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_316_320" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> apart from his rank, would have the same
veneration. He fought no battles for the eyes to feast upon;
but he has given his discoveries to all men. Oh! how brilliant
he was to the mind!</p>

<p>Jesus Christ, without riches, and without any external
exhibition of knowledge, is in His own order of holiness. He
did not invent; He did not reign. But He was humble, patient,
holy, holy to God, terrible to devils, without any sin. Oh! in
what great pomp, and in what wonderful splendour, He is come
to the eyes of the heart, which perceive wisdom!</p>

<p>It would have been useless for Archimedes to have acted
the prince in his books on geometry, although he was a
prince.</p>

<p>It would have been useless for our Lord Jesus Christ to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
come like a king, in order to shine forth in His kingdom of
holiness. But He came there appropriately in the glory of His
own order.</p>

<p>It is most absurd to take offence at the lowliness of Jesus
Christ, as if His lowliness were in the same order as the greatness
which He came to manifest. If we consider this greatness in
His life, in His passion, in His obscurity, in His death, in the
choice of His disciples, in their desertion, in His secret resurrection,
and the rest, we shall see it to be so immense, that we
shall have no reason for being offended at a lowliness which is
not of that order.</p>

<p>But there are some who can only admire worldly greatness,
as though there were no intellectual greatness; and others who
only admire intellectual greatness, as though there were not
infinitely higher things in wisdom.</p>

<p>All bodies, the firmament, the stars, the earth and its kingdoms,
are not equal to the lowest mind; for mind knows all
these and itself; and these bodies nothing.</p>

<p>All bodies together, and all minds together, and all their
products, are not equal to the least feeling of charity. This
is of an order infinitely more exalted.</p>

<p>From all bodies together, we cannot obtain one little thought;
this is impossible, and of another order. From all bodies and
minds, we cannot produce a feeling of true charity; this is
impossible, and of another and supernatural order.</p>


<h4><a name="p_793" id="p_793"></a>793</h4>

<p>Why did Jesus Christ not come in a visible manner, instead
of obtaining testimony of Himself from preceding prophecies?
Why did He cause Himself to be foretold in types?</p>


<h4><a name="p_794" id="p_794"></a>794</h4>

<p>If Jesus Christ had only come to sanctify, all Scripture and
all things would tend to that end; and it would be quite easy
to convince unbelievers. If Jesus Christ had only come to blind,
all His conduct would be confused; and we would have no
means of convincing unbelievers. But as He came <i>in sanctificationem
et in scandalum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_317_321" id="FNanchor_317_321"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_317_321" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> as Isaiah says, we cannot convince
unbelievers, and they cannot convince us. But by this very
fact we convince them; since we say that in His whole conduct
there is no convincing proof on one side or the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_795" id="p_795"></a>795</h4>

<p>Jesus Christ does not say that He is not of Nazareth, in order
to leave the wicked in their blindness; nor that He is not Joseph's
son.</p>


<h4><a name="p_796" id="p_796"></a>796</h4>

<p><i>Proofs of Jesus Christ.</i>—Jesus Christ said great things so
simply, that it seems as though He had not thought them great;
and yet so clearly that we easily see what He thought of them.
This clearness, joined to this simplicity, is wonderful.</p>


<h4><a name="p_797" id="p_797"></a>797</h4>

<p>The style of the gospel is admirable in so many ways, and
among the rest in hurling no invectives against the persecutors
and enemies of Jesus Christ. For there is no such invective
in any of the historians against Judas, Pilate, or any of the
Jews.</p>

<p>If this moderation of the writers of the Gospels had been
assumed, as well as many other traits of so beautiful a character,
and they had only assumed it to attract notice, even if they had
not dared to draw attention to it themselves, they would not
have failed to secure friends, who would have made such
remarks to their advantage. But as they acted thus without
pretence, and from wholly disinterested motives, they did not
point it out to any one; and I believe that many such facts have
not been noticed till now, which is evidence of the natural
disinterestedness with which the thing has been done.</p>


<h4><a name="p_798" id="p_798"></a>798</h4>

<p>An artisan who speaks of wealth, a lawyer who speaks of
war, of royalty, etc.; but the rich man rightly speaks of wealth,
a king speaks indifferently of a great gift he has just made,
and God rightly speaks of God.</p>


<h4><a name="p_799" id="p_799"></a>799</h4>

<p>Who has taught the evangelists the qualities of a perfectly
heroic soul, that they paint it so perfectly in Jesus Christ? Why
do they make Him weak in His agony? Do they not know
how to paint a resolute death? Yes, for the same Saint Luke
paints the death of Saint Stephen as braver than that of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>They make Him therefore capable of fear, before the necessity
of dying has come, and then altogether brave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>But when they make Him so troubled, it is when He afflicts
Himself; and when men afflict Him, He is altogether strong.</p>


<h4><a name="p_800" id="p_800"></a>800</h4>

<p><i>Proof of Jesus Christ.</i>—The supposition that the apostles
were impostors is very absurd. Let us think it out. Let us
imagine those twelve men, assembled after the death of Jesus
Christ, plotting to say that He was risen. By this they attack
all the powers. The heart of man is strangely inclined to
fickleness, to change, to promises, to gain. However little any
of them might have been led astray by all these attractions,
nay more, by the fear of prisons, tortures, and death, they were
lost. Let us follow up this thought.</p>


<h4><a name="p_801" id="p_801"></a>801</h4>

<p>The apostles were either deceived or deceivers. Either
supposition has difficulties; for it is not possible to mistake a
man raised from the dead ...</p>

<p>While Jesus Christ was with them, He could sustain them.
But, after that, if He did not appear to them, who inspired
them to act?</p>

<h3>THE MIRACLES</h3>


<h4><a name="p_802" id="p_802"></a>802</h4>

<p><i>The beginning.</i>—Miracles enable us to judge of doctrine, and
doctrine enables us to judge of miracles.</p>

<p>There are false miracles and true. There must be a distinction,
in order to know them; otherwise they would be useless.
Now they are not useless; on the contrary, they are fundamental.
Now the rule which is given to us must be such, that it does not
destroy the proof which the true miracles give of the truth,
which is the chief end of the miracles.</p>

<p>Moses has given two rules: that the prediction does not come
to pass (Deut. xviii), and that they do not lead to idolatry
(Deut. xiii); and Jesus Christ<a name="FNanchor_318_322" id="FNanchor_318_322"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_318_322" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> one.</p>

<p>If doctrine regulates miracles, miracles are useless for doctrine.</p>

<p>If miracles regulate....</p>

<p><i>Objection to the rule.</i>—The distinction of the times. One
rule during the time of Moses, another at present.</p>


<h4><a name="p_803" id="p_803"></a>803</h4>

<p><i>Miracle.</i>—It is an effect, which exceeds the natural power
of the means which are employed for it; and what is not a miracle
is an effect, which does not exceed the natural power of the
means which are employed for it. Thus, those who heal by
invocation of the devil do not work a miracle; for that does not
exceed the natural power of the devil. But ...</p>


<h4><a name="p_804" id="p_804"></a>804</h4>

<p>The two fundamentals; one inward, the other outward; grace
and miracles; both supernatural.</p>


<h4><a name="p_805" id="p_805"></a>805</h4>

<p>Miracles and truth are necessary, because it is necessary to
convince the entire man, in body and soul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_806" id="p_806"></a>806</h4>

<p>In all times, either men have spoken of the true God, or the
true God has spoken to men.</p>


<h4><a name="p_807" id="p_807"></a>807</h4>

<p>Jesus Christ has verified that He was the Messiah, never in
verifying His doctrine by Scripture and the prophecies, but
always by His miracles.</p>

<p>He proves by a miracle that He remits sins.</p>

<p>Rejoice not in your miracles, said Jesus Christ, but because
your names are written in heaven.<a name="FNanchor_319_323" id="FNanchor_319_323"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_319_323" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>If they believe not Moses, neither will they believe one risen
from the dead.</p>

<p>Nicodemus recognises by His miracles that His teaching is of
God. <i>Scimus quia venisti a Deo magister; nemo enim potest
hæc signa facere quæ tu facis nisi Deus fuerit cum eo.</i><a name="FNanchor_320_324" id="FNanchor_320_324"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_320_324" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> He does
not judge of the miracles by the teaching, but of the teaching
by the miracles.</p>

<p>The Jews had a doctrine of God as we have one of Jesus Christ,
and confirmed by miracles. They were forbidden to believe
every worker of miracles; and they were further commanded to
have recourse to the chief priests, and to rely on them.</p>

<p>And thus, in regard to their prophets, they had all those
reasons which we have for refusing to believe the workers of
miracles.</p>

<p>And yet they were very sinful in rejecting the prophets, and
Jesus Christ, because of their miracles; and they would not have
been culpable, if they had not seen the miracles. <i>Nisi fecissem
... peccatum non haberent.</i><a name="FNanchor_321_325" id="FNanchor_321_325"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_321_325" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Therefore all belief rests upon
miracles.</p>

<p>Prophecy is not called miracle; as Saint John speaks of the
first miracle in Cana, and then of what Jesus Christ says to the
woman of Samaria, when He reveals to her all her hidden life.
Then He heals the centurion's son; and Saint John calls this
"the second miracle."<a name="FNanchor_322_326" id="FNanchor_322_326"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_322_326" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>The combinations of miracles.</p>


<h4><a name="p_809" id="p_809"></a>809</h4>

<p>The second miracle can suppose the first, but the first cannot
suppose the second.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_810" id="p_810"></a>810</h4>

<p>Had it not been for the miracles, there would have been no
sin in not believing in Jesus Christ.</p>


<h4><a name="p_811" id="p_811"></a>811</h4>

<p>I should not be a Christian, but for the miracles, said Saint

Montaigne<a name="FNanchor_323_327" id="FNanchor_323_327"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_323_327" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> speaks of them as he should in two places. In one,
we see how careful he is; and yet, in the other, he believes, and
makes sport of unbelievers.</p>

<p>However it may be, the Church is without proofs if they are
right.</p>

<h4><a name="p_816" id="p_816"></a>816</h4>

<p><i>Title: How it happens that men believe so many liars, who
say that they have seen miracles, and do not believe any of those
who say that they have secrets to make men immortal, or restore
youth to them.</i>—Having considered how it happens that so great
credence is given to so many impostors, who say they have
remedies, often to the length of men putting their lives into
their hands, it has appeared to me that the true cause is that
there are true remedies. For it would not be possible that
there should be so many false remedies, and that so much faith
should be placed in them, if there were none true. If there
had never been any remedy for any ill, and all ills had been
incurable, it is impossible that men should have imagined that
they could give remedies, and still more impossible that so many
others should have believed those who boasted of having
remedies; in the same way as did a man boast of preventing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
death, no one would believe him, because there is no example of
this. But as there were a number of remedies found to be true
by the very knowledge of the greatest men, the belief of men is
thereby induced; and, this being known to be possible, it has
been therefore concluded that it was. For people commonly
reason thus: "A thing is possible, therefore it is"; because the
thing cannot be denied generally, since there are particular
effects which are true, the people, who cannot distinguish which
among these particular effects are true, believe them all. In
the same way, the reason why so many false effects are credited
to the moon, is that there are some true, as the tide.</p>

<p>It is the same with prophecies, miracles, divination by dreams,
sorceries, etc. For if there had been nothing true in all this,
men would have believed nothing of them; and thus, instead
of concluding that there are no true miracles because there are
so many false, we must, on the contrary, say that there certainly
are true miracles, since there are false, and that there are false
miracles only because some are true. We must reason in the
same way about religion; for it would not be possible that men
should have imagined so many false religions, if there had not
been a true one. The objection to this is that savages have a
religion; but the answer is that they have heard the true spoken
of, as appears by the deluge, circumcision, the cross of Saint
Andrew, etc.</p>


<h4><a name="p_817" id="p_817"></a>817</h4>

<p>Having considered how it comes that there are so many false
miracles, false revelations, sorceries, etc., it has seemed to me
that the true cause is that there are some true; for it would not
be possible that there should be so many false miracles, if there
were none true, nor so many false revelations, if there were
none true, nor so many false religions, if there were not one
true. For if there had never been all this, it is almost impossible
that men should have imagined it, and still more impossible
that so many others should have believed it. But as there
have been very great things true, and as they have been believed
by great men, this impression has been the cause that nearly
everybody is rendered capable of believing also the false. And
thus, instead of concluding that there are no true miracles,
since there are so many false, it must be said, on the contrary,
that there are true miracles, since there are so many false; and
that there are false ones only because there are true; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
in the same way there are false religions because there is one
true.—Objection to this: savages have a religion. But this is
because they have heard the true spoken of, as appears by the
cross of Saint Andrew, the deluge, circumcision, etc.—This
arises from the fact that the human mind, finding itself inclined
to that side by the truth, becomes thereby susceptible of all the
falsehoods of this ...</p>

<p><i>Miracle</i> does not always signify miracle. I Sam. xiv, 15;

evidently in Job xxxiii, 7; and also Isaiah xxi, 4; Jeremiah xliv,

<p>If the devil favoured the doctrine which destroys him, he
would be divided against himself, as Jesus Christ said. If

would be divided against Himself. <i>Omne regnum divisum.</i><a name="FNanchor_325_329" id="FNanchor_325_329"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_325_329" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
For Jesus Christ wrought against the devil, and destroyed his
power over the heart, of which exorcism is the symbolisation,
in order to establish the kingdom of God. And thus He adds,

<p>There is a great difference between tempting and leading
into error. God tempts, but He does not lead into error. To
tempt is to afford opportunities, which impose no necessity;
if men do not love God, they will do a certain thing. To lead
into error is to place a man under the necessity of inferring and
following out what is untrue.</p>

<p>If there were no false miracles, there would be certainty. If

<p>What makes us not believe in the true miracles, is want of
love. John: <i>Sed vos non creditis, quia non estis ex ovibus.</i><a name="FNanchor_329_333" id="FNanchor_329_333"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_329_333" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
What makes us believe the false is want of love. II Thess. ii.</p>

<p>The foundation of religion. It is the miracles. What then?
Does God speak against miracles, against the foundations of
the faith which we have in Him?</p>

<p>If there is a God, faith in God must exist on earth. Now the
miracles of Jesus Christ are not foretold by Antichrist, but the
miracles of Antichrist are foretold by Jesus Christ. And so if
Jesus Christ were not the Messiah, He would have indeed led
into error. When Jesus Christ foretold the miracles of Antichrist,
did He think of destroying faith in His own miracles?</p>

<p>Moses foretold Jesus Christ, and bade to follow Him. Jesus
Christ foretold Antichrist, and forbade to follow him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>It was impossible that in the time of Moses men should keep
their faith for Antichrist, who was unknown to them. But it
is quite easy, in the time of Antichrist, to believe in Jesus
Christ, already known.</p>

<p>There is no reason for believing in Antichrist, which there
is not for believing in Jesus Christ. But there are reasons for
believing in Jesus Christ, which there are not for believing in
the other.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ says that the Scriptures testify of Him. But
He does not point out in what respect.</p>

<p>Even the prophecies could not prove Jesus Christ during
His life; and so, men would not have been culpable for not
believing in Him before His death, had the miracles not sufficed
without doctrine. Now those who did not believe in Him,
when He was still alive, were sinners, as He said Himself, and
without excuse. Therefore they must have had proof beyond
doubt, which they resisted. Now, they had not the prophecies,
but only the miracles. Therefore the latter suffice, when the
doctrine is not inconsistent with them; and they ought to be
believed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>John vii, 40. <i>Dispute among the Jews as among the Christians
of to-day.</i> Some believed in Jesus Christ; others believed Him
not, because of the prophecies which said that He should be born
in Bethlehem. They should have considered more carefully
whether He was not. For His miracles being convincing, they
should have been quite sure of these supposed contradictions
of His teaching to Scripture; and this obscurity did not excuse,
but blinded them. Thus those who refuse to believe in the
miracles in the present day on account of a supposed contradiction,
which is unreal, are not excused.</p>

<p>The Pharisees said to the people, who believed in Him,
because of His miracles: "This people who knoweth not the
law are cursed. But have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees
believed on him? For we know that out of Galilee ariseth no
prophet." Nicodemus answered: "Doth our law judge any
man before it hear him, [and specially, such a man who works
such miracles]?"</p>

<p>Miracles are no longer necessary, because we have had them

Pope alone is offered to us; when he has been imposed upon;
and when the true source of truth, which is tradition, is thus
excluded; and the Pope, who is its guardian, is biased; the
truth is no longer free to appear. Then, as men speak no longer
of truth, truth itself must speak to men. This is what happened
in the time of Arius. (Miracles under Diocletian and under
Arius.)</p>

<p>John vi, 26: <i>Non quia vidisti signum, sed quia saturati estis.</i></p>

<p>Those who follow Jesus Christ because of His miracles honour
His power in all the miracles which it produces. But those
who, making profession to follow Him because of His miracles,
follow Him in fact only because He comforts them and satisfies
them with worldly blessings, discredit His miracles, when they
are opposed to their own comforts.</p>

<h4><a name="p_834" id="p_834"></a>834</h4>

<p>In the Old Testament, when they will turn you from God.
In the New, when they will turn you from Jesus Christ. These
are the occasions for excluding particular miracles from belief.
No others need be excluded.</p>

<p>Does it therefore follow that they would have the right to
exclude all the prophets who came to them? No; they would
have sinned in not excluding those who denied God, and would
have sinned in excluding those who did not deny God.</p>

<p>So soon, then, as we see a miracle, we must either assent to
it, or have striking proofs to the contrary. We must see if it
denies a God, or Jesus Christ, or the Church.</p>


<h4><a name="p_835" id="p_835"></a>835</h4>

<p>There is a great difference between not being for Jesus Christ
and saying so, and not being for Jesus Christ and pretending
to be so. The one party can do miracles, not the others. For
it is clear of the one party, that they are opposed to the truth,
but not of the others; and thus miracles are clearer.</p>


<h4><a name="p_836" id="p_836"></a>836</h4>

<p>That we must love one God only is a thing so evident, that it

<h4><a name="p_837" id="p_837"></a>837</h4>

<p>Jesus Christ performed miracles, then the apostles, and the
first saints in great number; because the prophecies not being
yet accomplished, but in the process of being accomplished by
them, the miracles alone bore witness to them. It was foretold
that the Messiah should convert the nations. How could this
prophecy be fulfilled without the conversion of the nations?
And how could the nations be converted to the Messiah, if they
did not see this final effect of the prophecies which prove Him?
Therefore, till He had died, risen again, and converted the
nations, all was not accomplished; and so miracles were needed
during all this time. Now they are no longer needed against
the Jews; for the accomplished prophecies constitute a lasting
miracle.</p>


<h4><a name="p_838" id="p_838"></a>838</h4>

<p>"Though ye believe not Me, believe at least the works."<a name="FNanchor_331_335" id="FNanchor_331_335"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_331_335" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> He
refers them, as it were, to the strongest proof.</p>

<p>It had been told to the Jews, as well as to Christians, that they
should not always believe the prophets; but yet the Pharisees
and Scribes are greatly concerned about His miracles, and try
to show that they are false, or wrought by the devil. For they
must needs be convinced, if they acknowledge that they are
of God.</p>

<p>At the present day we are not troubled to make this distinction.
Still it is very easy to do: those who deny neither
God nor Jesus Christ do no miracles which are not certain.
<i>Nemo facit virtutem in nomine meo, et cito possit de me male
loqui.</i><a name="FNanchor_332_336" id="FNanchor_332_336"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_332_336" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

relic.<a name="FNanchor_333_337" id="FNanchor_333_337"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_333_337" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Here is a thorn from the crown of the Saviour of the
world, over whom the prince of this world has no power, which
works miracles by the peculiar power of the blood shed for us.
Now God Himself chooses this house in order to display conspiciously
therein His power.</p>

<p>These are not men who do miracles by an unknown and
doubtful virtue, which makes a decision difficult for us. It is
God Himself. It is the instrument of the Passion of His only
Son, who, being in many places, chooses this, and makes men
come from all quarters there to receive these miraculous
alleviations in their weaknesses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_839" id="p_839"></a>839</h4>

<p>The Church has three kinds of enemies: the Jews, who have
never been of her body; the heretics, who have withdrawn from
it; and the evil Christians, who rend her from within.</p>

<p>These three kinds of different adversaries usually attack her
in different ways. But here they attack her in one and the
same way. As they are all without miracles, and as the Church
has always had miracles against them, they have all had the
same interest in evading them; and they all make use of this
excuse, that doctrine must not be judged by miracles, but
miracles by doctrine. There were two parties among those
who heard Jesus Christ: those who followed His teaching on
account of His miracles; others who said.... There were two
parties in the time of Calvin.... There are now the Jesuits, etc.</p>


<h4><a name="p_840" id="p_840"></a>840</h4>

<p>Miracles furnish the test in matters of doubt, between Jews
and heathens, Jews and Christians, Catholics and heretics, the
slandered and slanderers, between the two crosses.</p>

<p>But miracles would be useless to heretics; for the Church,
authorised by miracles which have already obtained belief, tells
us that they have not the true faith. There is no doubt that
they are not in it, since the first miracles of the Church exclude
belief of theirs. Thus there is miracle against miracle, both
the first and greatest being on the side of the Church.</p>

<p>These nuns,<a name="FNanchor_334_338" id="FNanchor_334_338"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_334_338" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> astonished at what is said, that they are in the
way of perdition; that their confessors are leading them to
Geneva; that they suggest to them that Jesus Christ is not in
the Eucharist, nor on the right hand of the Father; know that
all this is false, and therefore offer themselves to God in this
state. <i>Vide si via iniquitatis in me est.</i><a name="FNanchor_335_339" id="FNanchor_335_339"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_335_339" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> What happens thereupon?
This place, which is said to be the temple of the devil,
God makes His own temple. It is said that the children must
be taken away from it. God heals them there. It is said that
it is the arsenal of hell. God makes of it the sanctuary of
His grace. Lastly, they are threatened with all the fury and
vengeance of heaven; and God overwhelms them with favours.
A man would need to have lost his senses to conclude from this
that they are therefore in the way of perdition.</p>

<h4><a name="p_842" id="p_842"></a>842</h4>

<p>Here is not the country of truth. She wanders unknown
amongst men. God has covered her with a veil, which leaves
her unrecognised by those who do not hear her voice. Room
is opened for blasphemy, even against the truths that are at
least very likely. If the truths of the Gospel are published, the
contrary is published too, and the questions are obscured, so
that the people cannot distinguish. And they ask, "What
have you to make you believed rather than others? What sign
do you give? You have only words, and so have we. If you had
miracles, good and well." That doctrine ought to be supported
by miracles is a truth, which they misuse in order to revile
doctrine. And if miracles happen, it is said that miracles are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
not enough without doctrine; and this is another truth, which
they misuse in order to revile miracles.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ cured the man born blind, and performed a
number of miracles on the Sabbath day. In this way He
blinded the Pharisees, who said that miracles must be judged
by doctrine.</p>

<p>"We have Moses: but, as for this fellow, we know not from
whence he is."<a name="FNanchor_344_348" id="FNanchor_344_348"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_344_348" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> It is wonderful that you know not whence He
is, and yet He does such miracles.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ spoke neither against God, nor against Moses.</p>

<p>Antichrist and the false prophets, foretold by both Testaments,
will speak openly against God and against Jesus Christ. Who
is not hidden ... God would not allow him, who would be a
secret enemy, to do miracles openly.</p>

<p>In a public dispute where the two parties profess to be for
God, for Jesus Christ, for the Church, miracles have never been
on the side of the false Christians, and the other side has never
been without a miracle.</p>

<p>"He hath a devil." John x, 21. And others said, "Can a
devil open the eyes of the blind?"</p>

<p>The proofs which Jesus Christ and the apostles draw from
Scripture are not conclusive; for they say only that Moses
foretold that a prophet should come. But they do not thereby
prove that this is He; and that is the whole question. These
passages therefore serve only to show that they are not contrary
to Scripture, and that there appears no inconsistency, but not
that there is agreement. Now this is enough, namely, exclusion
of inconsistency, along with miracles.</p>

<p>There is a mutual duty between God and men. We must
pardon Him this saying: Quid debui?<a name="FNanchor_345_349" id="FNanchor_345_349"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_345_349" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> "Accuse me," said God
in Isaiah.</p>

<p>"God must fulfil His promises," etc.</p>

<p>Men owe it to God to accept the religion which He sends.
God owes it to men not to lead them into error. Now, they
would be led into error, if the workers of miracles announced a
doctrine which should not appear evidently false to the light of
common sense, and if a greater worker of miracles had not
already warned men not to believe them.</p>

<p>Thus, if there were divisions in the Church, and the Arians,
for example, who declared themselves founded on Scripture
just as the Catholics, had done miracles, and not the Catholics,
men should have been led into error.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>For, as a man, who announces to us the secrets of God, is not
worthy to be believed on his private authority, and that is why
the ungodly doubt him; so when a man, as a token of the communion
which he has with God, raises the dead, foretells the
future, removes the seas, heals the sick, there is none so wicked
as not to bow to him, and the incredulity of Pharaoh and the
Pharisees is the effect of a supernatural obduracy.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we see miracles and a doctrine not suspicious,
both on one side, there is no difficulty. But when we see miracles
and suspicious doctrine on the same side, we must then see which
is the clearest. Jesus Christ was suspected.</p>

<p>Bar-jesus blinded.<a name="FNanchor_346_350" id="FNanchor_346_350"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_346_350" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> The power of God surpasses that of His

know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?"</p>

<p>Miracles are for doctrine, and not doctrine for miracles.</p>

<p>If the miracles are true, shall we be able to persuade men
of all doctrine? No; for this will not come to pass. <i>Si

<p>Rule: we must judge of doctrine by miracles; we must judge
of miracles by doctrine. All this is true, but contains no
contradiction.</p>

<p>For we must distinguish the times.</p>

<p>How glad you are to know the general rules, thinking thereby
to set up dissension, and render all useless! We shall prevent
you, my father; truth is one and constant.</p>

<p>It is impossible, from the duty of God to men, that a man,
hiding his evil teaching, and only showing the good, saying
that he conforms to God and the Church, should do miracles
so as to instil insensibly a false and subtle doctrine. This
cannot happen.</p>

<p>And still less, that God, who knows the heart, should perform
miracles in favour of such a one.</p>


<h4><a name="p_843" id="p_843"></a>843</h4>

<p>The three marks of religion: perpetuity, a good life, miracles.
They destroy perpetuity by their doctrine of probability; a good
life by their morals; miracles by destroying either their truth or
the conclusions to be drawn from them.</p>

<p>If we believe them, the Church will have nothing to do with
perpetuity, holiness, and miracles. The heretics deny them,
or deny the conclusions to be drawn from them; they do the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
same. But one would need to have no sincerity in order to
deny them, or again to lose one's senses in order to deny the
conclusions to be drawn from them.</p>

<p>Nobody has ever suffered martyrdom for the miracles which
he says he has seen; for the folly of men goes perhaps to the
length of martyrdom, for those which the Turks believe by
tradition, but not for those which they have seen.</p>


<h4><a name="p_844" id="p_844"></a>844</h4>

<p>The heretics have always attacked these three marks, which
they have not.</p>


<h4><a name="p_845" id="p_845"></a>845</h4>

<p><i>First objection</i>: "An angel from heaven.<a name="FNanchor_349_353" id="FNanchor_349_353"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_349_353" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> We must not
judge of truth by miracles, but of miracles by truth. Therefore
the miracles are useless."</p>

<p>Now they are of use, and they must not be in opposition to
the truth. Therefore what Father Lingende<a name="FNanchor_350_354" id="FNanchor_350_354"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_350_354" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> has said, that
"God will not permit that a miracle may lead into error...."</p>

<p>When there shall be a controversy in the same Church, miracle
will decide.</p>

<p><i>Second objection</i>: "But Antichrist will do miracles."</p>

<p>The magicians of Pharaoh did not entice to error. Thus we
cannot say to Jesus respecting Antichrist, "You have led me
into error." For Antichrist will do them against Jesus Christ,
and so they cannot lead into error. Either God will not permit
false miracles, or He will procure greater.</p>

<p>[Jesus Christ has existed since the beginning of the world:
this is more impressive than all the miracles of Antichrist.]</p>

<p>If in the same Church there should happen a miracle on the
side of those in error, men would be led into error. Schism is
visible; a miracle is visible. But schism is more a sign of error
than a miracle is a sign of truth. Therefore a miracle cannot
lead into error.</p>

<p>But apart from schism, error is not so obvious as a miracle
is obvious. Therefore a miracle could lead into error.</p>

<p><i>Ubi est Deus tuus?</i><a name="FNanchor_351_355" id="FNanchor_351_355"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_351_355" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Miracles show Him, and are a light.</p>


<h4><a name="p_846" id="p_846"></a>846</h4>

<p>One of the anthems for Vespers at Christmas: <i>Exortum est in
tenebris lumen rectis corde.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_352_356" id="FNanchor_352_356"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_352_356" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>


<h4><a name="p_847" id="p_847"></a>847</h4>

<p>If the compassion of God is so great that He instructs us to
our benefit, even when He hides Himself, what light ought we
not to expect from Him when He reveals Himself?</p>


<h4><a name="p_848" id="p_848"></a>848</h4>

<p>Will <i>Est et non est</i> be received in faith itself as well as in
miracles? And if it is inseparable in the others ...</p>

<p>When Saint Xavier<a name="FNanchor_353_357" id="FNanchor_353_357"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_353_357" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> works miracles.—[Saint Hilary. "Ye
wretches, who oblige us to speak of miracles."]</p>

<p>Unjust judges, make not your own laws on the moment;
judge by those which are established, and by yourselves. <i>Væ
qui conditis leges iniquas.</i><a name="FNanchor_354_358" id="FNanchor_354_358"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_354_358" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>Miracles endless, false.</p>

<p>In order to weaken your adversaries, you disarm the whole
Church.</p>

<p>If they say that our salvation depends upon God, they are
"heretics." If they say that they are obedient to the Pope,
that is "hypocrisy." If they are ready to subscribe to all the
articles, that is not enough. If they say that a man must not
be killed for an apple, "they attack the morality of Catholics."
If miracles are done among them, it is not a sign of holiness, and
is, on the contrary, a symptom of heresy.</p>

<p>This way in which the Church has existed is that truth has
been without dispute, or, if it has been contested, there has
been the Pope, or, failing him, there has been the Church.</p>


<h4><a name="p_849" id="p_849"></a>849</h4>

<p>The five propositions<a name="FNanchor_355_359" id="FNanchor_355_359"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_355_359" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> condemned, but no miracle; for the
truth was not attacked. But the Sorbonne ... but the bull....</p>

<p>It is impossible that those who love God with all their heart
should fail to recognise the Church; so evident is she.—It is
impossible that those who do not love God should be convinced
of the Church.</p>

<p>Miracles have such influence that it was necessary that God
should warn men not to believe in them in opposition to Him,
all clear as it is that there is a God. Without this they would
have been able to disturb men.</p>

<p>And thus so far from these passages, Deut. xiii, making
against the authority of the miracles, nothing more indicates
their influence. And the same in respect of Antichrist. "To
seduce, if it were possible, even the elect."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_356_360" id="FNanchor_356_360"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_356_360" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>


<h4><a name="p_850" id="p_850"></a>850</h4>

<p>The history of the man born blind.</p>

<p>What says Saint Paul? Does he continually speak of the
evidence of the prophecies? No, but of his own miracle. What
says Jesus Christ? Does He speak of the evidence of the
prophecies? No; His death had not fulfilled them. But He
says, <i>Si non fecissem</i>.<a name="FNanchor_357_361" id="FNanchor_357_361"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_357_361" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Believe the works.</p>

<p>Two supernatural foundations of our wholly supernatural
religion; one visible, the other invisible; miracles with grace,
miracles without grace.</p>

<p>The synagogue, which had been treated with love as a type
of the Church, and with hatred, because it was only the type,
has been restored, being on the point of falling when it was
well with God, and thus a type.</p>

<p>Miracles prove the power which God has over hearts, by that
which He exercises over bodies.</p>

<p>The Church has never approved a miracle among heretics.</p>

<p>Miracles a support of religion: they have been the test of Jews;
they have been the test of Christians, saints, innocents, and
true believers.</p>

<p>A miracle among schismatics is not so much to be feared;
for schism, which is more obvious than a miracle, visibly indicates
their error. But when there is no schism, and error is
in question, miracle decides.</p>

<p><i>Si non fecissem quæ alius non fecit.</i> The wretches who have
obliged us to speak of miracles.</p>

<p>Abraham and Gideon confirm faith by miracles.</p>

<p>Judith. God speaks at last in their greatest oppression.</p>

<p>If the cooling of love leaves the Church almost without
believers, miracles will rouse them. This is one of the last
effects of grace.</p>

<p>If one miracle were wrought among the Jesuits!</p>

<p>When a miracle disappoints the expectation of those in
whose presence it happens, and there is a disproportion between
the state of their faith and the instrument of the miracle, it
ought then to induce them to change. But with you it is
otherwise. There would be as much reason in saying that, if
the Eucharist raised a dead man, it would be necessary for one
to turn a Calvinist rather than remain a Catholic. But when
it crowns the expectation, and those, who hoped that God
would bless the remedies, see themselves healed without
remedies ...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The ungodly.</i>—No sign has ever happened on the part of the
devil without a stronger sign on the part of God, or even without
it having been foretold that such would happen.</p>


<h4><a name="p_851" id="p_851"></a>851</h4>

<p>Unjust persecutors of those whom God visibly protects.
If they reproach you with your excesses, "they speak as the
heretics." If they say that the grace of Jesus Christ distinguishes
us, "they are heretics." If they do miracles, "it is
the mark of their heresy."</p>

<p>Ezekiel.—They say: These are the people of God who speak
thus.</p>

<p>It is said, "Believe in the Church";<a name="FNanchor_358_362" id="FNanchor_358_362"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_358_362" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> but it is not said,
"Believe in miracles"; because the last is natural, and not the
first. The one had need of a precept, not the other. Hezekiah.</p>

<p>The synagogue was only a type, and thus it did not perish;
and it was only a type, and so it is decayed. It was a type
which contained the truth, and thus it has lasted until it no
longer contained the truth.</p>

<p>My reverend father, all this happened in types. Other
religions perish; this one perishes not.</p>

<p>Miracles are more important than you think. They have
served for the foundation, and will serve for the continuation
of the Church till Antichrist, till the end.</p>

<p>The two witnesses.</p>

<p>In the Old Testament and the New, miracles are performed in
connection with types. Salvation, or a useless thing, if not to
show that we must submit to the Scriptures: type of the
sacrament.</p>


<h4><a name="p_852" id="p_852"></a>852</h4>

<p>[We must judge soberly of divine ordinances, my father.</p>

<p>Saint Paul in the isle of Malta.]</p>


<h4><a name="p_853" id="p_853"></a>853</h4>

<p>The hardness of the Jesuits, then, surpasses that of the Jews,
since those refused to believe Jesus Christ innocent only because
they doubted if His miracles were of God. Whereas the Jesuits,
though unable to doubt that the miracles of Port-Royal are of
God, do not cease to doubt still the innocence of that house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_854" id="p_854"></a>854</h4>

either in favour of your friends, or against your enemies. You

<h3>APPENDIX: POLEMICAL FRAGMENTS</h3>


<h4><a name="p_856" id="p_856"></a>856</h4>

<p><i>Clearness, obscurity.</i>—There would be too great darkness, if
truth had not visible signs. This is a wonderful one, that it
has always been preserved in one Church and one visible
assembly [of men]. There would be too great clearness, if
there were only one opinion in this Church. But in order to
recognise what is true, one has only to look at what has always
existed; for it is certain that truth has always existed, and
that nothing false has always existed.</p>


<h4><a name="p_857" id="p_857"></a>857</h4>

<p>The history of the Church ought properly to be called the
history of truth.</p>


<h4><a name="p_858" id="p_858"></a>858</h4>

<p>There is a pleasure in being in a ship beaten about by a
storm, when we are sure that it will not founder. The persecutions
which harass the Church are of this nature.</p>


<h4><a name="p_859" id="p_859"></a>859</h4>

<p>In addition to so many other signs of piety, they<a name="FNanchor_359_363" id="FNanchor_359_363"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_359_363" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> are also
persecuted, which is the best sign of piety.</p>


<h4><a name="p_860" id="p_860"></a>860</h4>

<p>The Church is in an excellent state, when it is sustained by
God only.</p>


<h4><a name="p_861" id="p_861"></a>861</h4>

<p>The Church has always been attacked by opposite errors,
but perhaps never at the same time, as now. And if she suffer
more because of the multiplicity of errors, she derives this
advantage from it, that they destroy each other.</p>

<p>She complains of both, but far more of the Calvinists, because
of the schism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>It is certain that many of the two opposite sects are deceived.
They must be disillusioned.</p>

<p>Faith embraces many truths which seem to contradict each
other. <i>There is a time to laugh, and a time to weep</i>,<a name="FNanchor_360_364" id="FNanchor_360_364"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_360_364" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> etc. <i>Responde.
Ne respondeas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_361_365" id="FNanchor_361_365"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_361_365" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> etc.</p>

<p>The source of this is the union of the two natures in Jesus
Christ; and also the two worlds (the creation of a new heaven
and a new earth; a new life and a new death; all things double,
and the same names remaining); and finally the two natures
that are in the righteous, (for they are the two worlds, and a
member and image of Jesus Christ. And thus all the names
suit them: righteous, yet sinners; dead, yet living; living, yet
dead; elect, yet outcast, etc.).</p>

<p>There are then a great number of truths, both of faith and of
morality, which seem contradictory, and which all hold good
together in a wonderful system. The source of all heresies is
the exclusion of some of these truths; and the source of all the
objections which the heretics make against us is the ignorance
of some of our truths. And it generally happens that, unable
to conceive the connection of two opposite truths, and believing
that the admission of one involves the exclusion of the other,
they adhere to the one, exclude the other, and think of us as
opposed to them. Now exclusion is the cause of their heresy;
and ignorance that we hold the other truth causes their objections.</p>

<p>1st example: Jesus Christ is God and man. The Arians,
unable to reconcile these things, which they believe incompatible,
say that He is man; in this they are Catholics. But they deny
that He is God; in this they are heretics. They allege that we
deny His humanity; in this they are ignorant.</p>

<p>2nd example: On the subject of the Holy Sacrament. We
believe that, the substance of the bread being changed, and
being consubstantial with that of the body of our Lord, Jesus
Christ is therein really present. That is one truth. Another
is that this Sacrament is also a type of the cross and of glory,
and a commemoration of the two. That is the Catholic faith,
which comprehends these two truths which seem opposed.</p>

<p>The heresy of to-day, not conceiving that this Sacrament
contains at the same time both the presence of Jesus Christ
and a type of Him, and that it is a sacrifice and a commemoration
of a sacrifice, believes that neither of these truths can be admitted
without excluding the other for this reason.</p>

<p>They fasten to this point alone, that this Sacrament is typical;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
and in this they are not heretics. They think that we exclude
this truth; hence it comes that they raise so many objections to
us out of the passages of the Fathers which assert it. Finally,
they deny the presence; and in this they are heretics.</p>

<p>3rd example: Indulgences.</p>

<p>The shortest way, therefore, to prevent heresies is to instruct
in all truths; and the surest way to refute them is to declare
them all. For what will the heretics say?</p>

<p>In order to know whether an opinion is a Father's ...</p>


<h4><a name="p_862" id="p_862"></a>862</h4>

<p>All err the more dangerously, as they each follow a truth.
Their fault is not in following a falsehood, but in not following
another truth.</p>


<h4><a name="p_863" id="p_863"></a>863</h4>

<p>Truth is so obscure in these times, and falsehood so established,
that unless we love the truth, we cannot know it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_864" id="p_864"></a>864</h4>

<p>If there is ever a time in which we must make profession of
two opposite truths, it is when we are reproached for omitting
one. Therefore the Jesuits and Jansenists are wrong in concealing
them, but the Jansenists more so, for the Jesuits have
better made profession of the two.</p>


<h4><a name="p_865" id="p_865"></a>865</h4>

<p>Two kinds of people make things equal to one another, as
feasts to working days, Christians to priests, all things among
them, etc. And hence the one party conclude that what is
then bad for priests is also so for Christians, and the other that
what is not bad for Christians is lawful for priests.</p>


<h4><a name="p_866" id="p_866"></a>866</h4>

<p>If the ancient Church was in error, the Church is fallen. If
she should be in error to-day, it is not the same thing; for she
has always the superior maxim of tradition from the hand of the
ancient Church; and so this submission and this conformity to
the ancient Church prevail and correct all. But the ancient
Church did not assume the future Church, and did not consider
her, as we assume and consider the ancient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_867" id="p_867"></a>867</h4>

<p>That which hinders us in comparing what formerly occurred
in the Church with what we see there now, is that we generally
look upon Saint Athanasius,<a name="FNanchor_362_366" id="FNanchor_362_366"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_362_366" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Saint Theresa, and the rest, as
crowned with glory, and acting towards us as gods. Now that
time has cleared up things, it does so appear. But at the time
when he was persecuted, this great saint was a man called
Athanasius; and Saint Theresa was a nun. "Elias was a man
subject to like passions as we are," says Saint James, to disabuse
Christians of that false idea which makes us reject the
example of the saints, as disproportioned to our state. "They
were saints," say we, "they are not like us." What then
actually happened? Saint Athanasius was a man called Athanasius,
accused of many crimes, condemned by such and such
a council for such and such a crime. All the bishops assented
to it, and finally the Pope. What said they to those who
opposed this? That they disturbed the peace, that they
created schism, etc.</p>

<p>Zeal, light. Four kinds of persons: zeal without knowledge;
knowledge without zeal; neither knowledge nor zeal; both zeal
and knowledge. The first three condemned him. The last
acquitted him, were excommunicated by the Church, and yet
saved the Church.</p>


<h4><a name="p_868" id="p_868"></a>868</h4>

<p>If Saint Augustine came at the present time, and was as
little authorised as his defenders, he would accomplish nothing.
God directs His Church well, by having sent him before with
authority.</p>


<h4><a name="p_869" id="p_869"></a>869</h4>

<p>God has not wanted to absolve without the Church. As she
has part in the offence, He desires her to have part in the pardon.
He associates her with this power, as kings their parliaments.
But if she absolves or binds without God, she is no longer the
Church. For, as in the case of parliament, even if the king
have pardoned a man, it must be ratified; but if parliament
ratifies without the king, or refuses to ratify on the order of
the king, it is no longer the parliament of the king, but a
rebellious assembly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>


<h4><a name="p_870" id="p_870"></a>870</h4>

<p><i>The Church, the Pope. Unity, plurality.</i>—Considering the
Church as a unity, the Pope, who is its head, is as the whole.
Considering it as a plurality, the Pope is only a part of it. The
Fathers have considered the Church now in the one way, now
in the other. And thus they have spoken differently of the Pope.
(Saint Cyprian: <i>Sacerdos Dei.</i>) But in establishing one of these
truths, they have not excluded the other. Plurality which is
not reduced to unity is confusion; unity which does not depend
on plurality is tyranny. There is scarcely any other country
than France in which it is permissible to say that the Council
is above the Pope.</p>


<h4><a name="p_871" id="p_871"></a>871</h4>

<p>The Pope is head. Who else is known of all? Who else is
recognised by all, having power to insinuate himself into all the
body, because he holds the principal shoot, which insinuates
itself everywhere? How easy it was to make this degenerate
into tyranny! That is why Christ has laid down for them this
precept: <i>Vos autem non sic.</i><a name="FNanchor_363_367" id="FNanchor_363_367"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_363_367" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>


<h4><a name="p_872" id="p_872"></a>872</h4>

<p>The Pope hates and fears the learned, who do not submit
to him at will.</p>


<h4><a name="p_873" id="p_873"></a>873</h4>

<p>We must not judge of what the Pope is by some words of the
Fathers—as the Greeks said in a council, important rules—but
by the acts of the Church and the Fathers, and by the canons.</p>

<p><i>Duo aut tres in unum.</i><a name="FNanchor_364_368" id="FNanchor_364_368"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_364_368" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Unity and plurality. It is an error
to exclude one of the two, as the papists do who exclude plurality,
or the Huguenots who exclude unity.</p>


<h4><a name="p_874" id="p_874"></a>874</h4>

<p>Would the Pope be dishonoured by having his knowledge
from God and tradition; and is it not dishonouring him to
separate him from this holy union?</p>


<h4><a name="p_875" id="p_875"></a>875</h4>

<p>God does not perform miracles in the ordinary conduct of
His Church. It would be a strange miracle if infallibility
existed in one man. But it appears so natural for it to reside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
in a multitude, since the conduct of God is hidden under nature,
as in all His other works.</p>


<h4><a name="p_876" id="p_876"></a>876</h4>

<p>Kings dispose of their own power; but the Popes cannot
dispose of theirs.</p>


<h4><a name="p_877" id="p_877"></a>877</h4>

<p><i>Summum jus, summa injuria.</i></p>

<p>The majority is the best way, because it is visible, and has
strength to make itself obeyed. Yet it is the opinion of the
least able.</p>

<p>If men could have done it, they would have placed might in
the hands of justice. But as might does not allow itself to be
managed as men want, because it is a palpable quality, whereas
justice is a spiritual quality of which men dispose as they please,
they have placed justice in the hands of might. And thus that
is called just which men are forced to obey.</p>

<p>Hence comes the right of the sword, for the sword gives a
true right. Otherwise we should see violence on one side and
justice on the other (end of the twelfth <i>Provincial</i>). Hence
comes the injustice of the Fronde,<a name="FNanchor_365_369" id="FNanchor_365_369"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_365_369" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> which raises its alleged justice
against power. It is not the same in the Church, for there is a
true justice and no violence.</p>


<h4><a name="p_878" id="p_878"></a>878</h4>

<p><i>Injustice.</i>—Jurisdiction is not given for the sake of the judge,
but for that of the litigant. It is dangerous to tell this to the
people. But the people have too much faith in you; it will not
harm them, and may serve you. It should therefore be made
known. <i>Pasce oves meas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_366_370" id="FNanchor_366_370"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_366_370" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> non <i>tuas</i>. You owe me pasturage.</p>


<h4><a name="p_879" id="p_879"></a>879</h4>

<p>Men like certainty. They like the Pope to be infallible in
faith, and grave doctors to be infallible in morals, so as to have
certainty.</p>


<h4><a name="p_880" id="p_880"></a>880</h4>

<p>The Church teaches, and God inspires, both infallibly. The
work of the Church is of use only as a preparation for grace or

<p>It is a horrible thing that they propound to us the discipline
of the Church of to-day as so good, that it is made a crime to
desire to change it. Formerly it was infallibly good, and it was
thought that it could be changed without sin; and now, such as
it is, we cannot wish it changed! It has indeed been permitted
to change the custom of not making priests without such great
circumspection, that there were hardly any who were worthy;
and it is not allowed to complain of the custom which makes so
many who are unworthy!</p>


<h4><a name="p_885" id="p_885"></a>885</h4>

<p><i>Heretics.</i>—Ezekiel. All the heathen, and also the Prophet,
spoke evil of Israel. But the Israelites were so far from having
the right to say to him, "You speak like the heathen," that he
is most forcible upon this, that the heathen say the same as he.</p>

<h4><a name="p_887" id="p_887"></a>887</h4>

<p>You are ignorant of the prophecies, if you do not know that
all this must happen; princes, prophets, Pope, and even the
priests. And yet the Church is to abide. By the grace of God
we have not come to that. Woe to these priests! But we hope
that God will bestow His mercy upon us that we shall not be
of them.</p>

<p>Saint Peter, ii: false prophets in the past, the image of future
ones.</p>


<h4><a name="p_888" id="p_888"></a>888</h4>

<p>... So that if it is true, on the one hand, that some lax
monks, and some corrupt casuists, who are not members of
the hierarchy, are steeped in these corruptions, it is, on the
other hand, certain that the true pastors of the Church, who
are the true guardians of the Divine Word, have preserved it
unchangeably against the efforts of those who have attempted
to destroy it.</p>

<p>And thus true believers have no pretext to follow that laxity,
which is only offered to them by the strange hands of these
casuists, instead of the sound doctrine which is presented to them
by the fatherly hands of their own pastors. And the ungodly
and heretics have no ground for publishing these abuses as
evidence of imperfection in the providence of God over His
Church; since, the Church consisting properly in the body of
the hierarchy, we are so far from being able to conclude from
the present state of matters that God has abandoned her to
corruption, that it has never been more apparent than at the
present time that God visibly protects her from corruption.</p>

<p>For if some of these men, who, by an extraordinary vocation,
have made profession of withdrawing from the world and
adopting the monks' dress, in order to live in a more perfect
state than ordinary Christians, have fallen into excesses which
horrify ordinary Christians, and have become to us what the
false prophets were among the Jews; this is a private and personal
misfortune, which must indeed be deplored, but from which
nothing can be inferred against the care which God takes of
His Church; since all these things are so clearly foretold, and it
has been so long since announced that these temptations would
arise from people of this kind; so that when we are well instructed,
we see in this rather evidence of the care of God than
of His forgetfulness in regard to us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must indeed be," says Feuillant, "that this is not so

<p>The Jesuits have not made the truth uncertain, but they have

<p>Contradiction has always been permitted, in order to blind

<h4><a name="p_902" id="p_902"></a>902</h4>

<p>All religions and sects in the world have had natural reason
for a guide. Christians alone have been constrained to take
their rules from without themselves, and to acquaint themselves
with those which Jesus Christ bequeathed to men of old
to be handed down to true believers. This constraint wearies
these good Fathers. They desire, like other people, to have
liberty to follow their own imaginations. It is in vain that we
cry to them, as the prophets said to the Jews of old: "Enter into
the Church; acquaint yourselves with the precepts which the
men of old left to her, and follow those paths." They have
answered like the Jews: "We will not walk in them; but we will
follow the thoughts of our hearts"; and they have said, "We
will be as the other nations."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_373_377" id="FNanchor_373_377"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_373_377" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>


<h4><a name="p_903" id="p_903"></a>903</h4>

<p>They make a rule of exception.</p>

<p>Have the men of old given absolution before penance? Do
this as exceptional. But of the exception you make a rule
without exception, so that you do not even want the rule to
be exceptional.</p>


<h4><a name="p_904" id="p_904"></a>904</h4>

<p><i>On confessions and absolutions without signs of regret.</i></p>

<p>God regards only the inward; the Church judges only by the
outward. God absolves as soon as He sees penitence in the
heart; the Church when she sees it in works. God will make a
Church pure within, which confounds, by its inward and
entirely spiritual holiness, the inward impiety of proud sages
and Pharisees; and the Church will make an assembly of men
whose external manners are so pure as to confound the manners
of the heathen. If there are hypocrites among them, but so
well disguised that she does not discover their venom, she
tolerates them; for, though they are not accepted of God, whom
they cannot deceive, they are of men, whom they do deceive.
And thus she is not dishonoured by their conduct, which appears
holy. But you want the Church to judge neither of the inward,
because that belongs to God alone, nor of the outward, because
God dwells only upon the inward; and thus, taking away from
her all choice of men, you retain in the Church the most dissolute,
and those who dishonour her so greatly, that the synagogues of
the Jews and sects of philosophers would have banished them
as unworthy, and have abhorred them as impious.</p>


<h4><a name="p_905" id="p_905"></a>905</h4>

<p>The easiest conditions to live in according to the world are
the most difficult to live in according to God, and vice versa.
Nothing is so difficult according to the world as the religious
life; nothing is easier than to live it according to God. Nothing
is easier, according to the world, than to live in high office and
great wealth; nothing is more difficult than to live in them
according to God, and without acquiring an interest in them
and a liking for them.</p>


<h4><a name="p_906" id="p_906"></a>906</h4>

<p>The casuists submit the decision to the corrupt reason,
and the choice of decisions to the corrupt will, in order that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
that is corrupt in the nature of man may contribute to his
conduct.</p>


<h4><a name="p_907" id="p_907"></a>907</h4>

<p>But is it <i>probable</i> that <i>probability</i> gives assurance?</p>

<p>Difference between rest and security of conscience. Nothing
gives certainty but truth; nothing gives rest but the sincere
search for truth.</p>


<h4><a name="p_908" id="p_908"></a>908</h4>

<p>The whole society itself of their casuists cannot give assurance
to a conscience in error, and that is why it is important to
choose good guides.</p>

<p>Thus they will be doubly culpable, both in having followed
ways which they should not have followed, and in having
listened to teachers to whom they should not have listened.</p>


<h4><a name="p_909" id="p_909"></a>909</h4>

<p>Can it be anything but compliance with the world which
makes you find things probable? Will you make us believe

bounds. Again, there are many people who see the truth, and
who cannot attain to it; but there are few who do not know
that the purity of religion is opposed to our corruptions. It is
absurd to say that an eternal recompense is offered to the
morality of Escobar.</p>

of the saints who have always followed the surest way (Saint
Theresa having always followed her confessor).</p>


<h4><a name="p_917" id="p_917"></a>917</h4>

give <i>probability</i>, and you can no longer displease it.</p>


<h4><a name="p_918" id="p_918"></a>918</h4>

<p>These are the effects of the sins of the peoples and of the
Jesuits. The great have wished to be flattered. The Jesuits
have wished to be loved by the great. They have all been
worthy to be abandoned to the spirit of lying, the one party
to deceive, the others to be deceived. They have been avaricious,
ambitious, voluptuous. <i>Coacervabunt tibi magistros.</i><a name="FNanchor_377_381" id="FNanchor_377_381"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_377_381" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Worthy
disciples of such masters, they have sought flatterers, and have
found them.</p>


<h4><a name="p_919" id="p_919"></a>919</h4>

<p>If they do not renounce their doctrine of probability, their
good maxims are as little holy as the bad, for they are founded
on human authority; and thus, if they are more just, they will
be more reasonable, but not more holy. They take after the
wild stem on which they are grafted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>If what I say does not serve to enlighten you, it will be of use
to the people.</p>

<p>If these<a name="FNanchor_378_382" id="FNanchor_378_382"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_378_382" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> are silent, the stones will speak.</p>

<p>Silence is the greatest persecution; the saints were never
silent. It is true that a call is necessary; but it is not from the
decrees of the Council that we must learn whether we are called,
it is from the necessity of speaking. Now, after Rome has
spoken, and we think that she has condemned the truth, and
that they have written it, and after the books which have said
the contrary are censured; we must cry out so much the louder,
the more unjustly we are censured, and the more violently they
would stifle speech, until there come a Pope who hears both
parties, and who consults antiquity to do justice. So the good
Popes will find the Church still in outcry.</p>

<p>The Inquisition and the Society<a name="FNanchor_379_383" id="FNanchor_379_383"></a><a href="./Pensées.html#Footnote_379_383" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> are the two scourges of the
truth.</p>

<p>Why do you not accuse them of Arianism? For, though
they have said that Jesus Christ is God, perhaps they mean
by it not the natural interpretation, but as it is said, <i>Dii
estis</i>.</p>

<p>If my Letters are condemned at Rome, that which I condemn
in them is condemned in heaven. <i>Ad tuum, Domine Jesu,
tribunal appello.</i></p>

<p>You yourselves are corruptible.</p>

<p>I feared that I had written ill, seeing myself condemned;
but the example of so many pious writings makes me believe
the contrary. It is no longer allowable to write well, so corrupt
or ignorant is the Inquisition!</p>

<p>"It is better to obey God than men."</p>

<p>I fear nothing; I hope for nothing. It is not so with the
bishops. Port-Royal fears, and it is bad policy to disperse
them; for they will fear no longer and will cause greater fear.
I do not even fear your like censures, if they are not founded on
those of tradition. Do you censure all? What! even my respect?
No. Say then what, or you will do nothing, if you do not point
out the evil, and why it is evil. And this is what they will have
great difficulty in doing.</p>

<p><i>Probability.</i>—They have given a ridiculous explanation of
certitude; for, after having established that all their ways are
sure, they have no longer called that sure which leads to heaven
without danger of not arriving there by it, but that which
leads there without danger of going out of that road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

defend error and injustice. Let God, out of His compassion,

there was inserted the following fragment after No. 513:
</p><p>
"Work out your own salvation with fear."
</p><p>
Proofs of prayer. <i>Petenti dabitur.</i>
</p><p>
Therefore it is in our power to ask. On the other hand, there is
God. So it is not in our power, since the obtaining of (the grace) to
pray to Him is not in our power. For since salvation is not in us,
and the obtaining of such grace is from Him, prayer is not in our
power.
</p><p>
The righteous man should then hope no more in God, for he
ought not to hope, but to strive to obtain what he wants.
</p><p>
Let us conclude then that, since man is now unrighteous since
the first sin, and God is unwilling that he should thereby not be
estranged from Him, it is only by a first effect that he is not estranged.
</p><p>
Therefore, those who depart from God have not this first effect
without which they are not estranged from God, and those who do
not depart from God have this first effect. Therefore, those whom
we have seen possessed for some time of grace by this first effect,
cease to pray, for want of this first effect.
</p><p>
Then God abandons the first in this sense.
</p><p>
It is doubtful, however that this fragment should be included
in the <i>Pensées</i>, and it has seemed best to separate it from the text.
It has only once before appeared—in the edition of Michaut (1896).
The first half of it has been freely translated in order to give an
interpretation in accordance with a suggestion from M. Emile
Boutroux, the eminent authority on Pascal. The meaning seems
to be this. In one sense it is in our power to ask from God, who
promises to give us what we ask. But, in another sense, it is not
in our power to ask; for it is not in our power to obtain the grace
which is necessary in asking. We know that salvation is not in our
power. Therefore some condition of salvation is not in our power.
Now the conditions of salvation are two: (1) The asking for it, and
(2) the obtaining it. But God promises to give us what we ask.
Hence the obtaining is in our power. Therefore the condition
which is not in our power must be the first, namely, the asking.
Prayer presupposes a grace which it is not within our power to obtain.
</p><p>
After giving the utmost consideration to the second half of this
obscure fragment, and seeking assistance from some eminent
scholars, the translator has been compelled to give a strictly literal
translation of it, without attempting to make sense.</p></div>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
